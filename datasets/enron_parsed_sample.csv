Feudalism
You have two cows.
Your lord takes some of the milk.

----------

Fascism
You have two cows.
The government takes both, hires you to take care of them and sells you the
milk.

----------

Pure Communism
You have two cows.
Your neighbours help take care of them and you all share the milk.

----------

Applied Communism
You have two cows.
You must take care of them, but the government takes all the milk.

----------

Totalitarianism
You have two cows.
The government takes them both and denies they ever existed. Milk is banned.

----------

Pure Democracy
You have two cows.
You and your neighbours decide who gets the milk.

----------

Representative Democracy
You have two cows.
Your neighbours pick someone to tell you who gets the milk.

Mexican Democracy
You have two cows.
The government takes both and drafts you into the army.


----------

European Democracy
You have two cows.
The EU commission decides which regulations for feeding and milking apply.
If
there aren't any, they invent some. They pay you not to milk the cows.
They take both cows, shoot one, milk the other and pour the milk down the
drain.
They then require you to fill out forms accounting for the missing cows.


----------

American Democracy
The government promises to give you two cows, if you vote for it.
After the election, the president is impeached for speculating in cow
futures.
The press dubs the affair ""cowgate,"" but supports the president.
The cows sue you for breach of contract.
Your legal bills exceed your annual income.
You settle out of court and declare bankruptcy.


----------


Capitalism
You have two cows.
You sell one and buy a bull.
Your herd multiplies, and the economy grows. You sell them and retire on the
income.


----------

Enron Venture Capitalism
You have two cows.
You sell three of them to your publicly listed company, using letters of
credit
opened by your brother-in-law at the bank, then execute a debt/equity swap
with
an associated general offer so that you get all four cows back, with a tax
exemption for five cows.  The milk rights of the six cows are transferred
via an
intermediary to a Cayman Island company secretly owned by the majority
shareholder who sells the rights to all seven cows back to your listed
company.
The annual report says the company owns eight cows, with an option on one
more.

How are you? Just want to say hi. It must be a very hectic week and
stressful. With the talents of people at Enron such as yourself being the
major asset of the company, the industry recognizes that fact. I am sure
that you will do well. In the mean time, hold tight, pray, and have faith. 

Keep in touch.

Do you have any recon.... on exactly which plants DWR has the right to bring the fuel on. As Mark indicated, it was about 1/3 of their exposure, and most of that was in the south service area, but I am very interested in the actual facilities and whom used to bring fuel to them or run the units.'

There is a zero sum game on fuel... but the landscape changes depending on who buys it and how they buy it!

The 30,000/day of capacity will sit on the books until next week but the deal with HUBER is effectively completed. In the event that this deal does not close, then the West desk will resume with the same MTM risks that you presently have.  

Any curve shift positive from now until the transaction is actually unwound will be credited back to the orig desk and any negative curve shift from here on in will be credited to the trading desk... plus ENA Orig and trading will work on a sharing calculation payable for any future deals. 

In addition to the transportation income being generated, additional orig will be generated by entering into wellhead and market based transactions with the desks. I believe that all of the risks and discussions associated with the structures have been well communicated with each book ( by Mark Whitt ) and we will be meeting with each of you early next week to get the structures and booking set up properly.

You and I need to hook up on Monday to discuss plan of attack regarding gas and as per your original message I agree with you, it starts with some basic discussions around their intent, vs trying to bang out a Master agreement that may go no where. 

Talk to you today I hope.

As previously discussed seeing the DWR rfp will require some credit and contract enhancements and that process is underway but it is moving slower and with less push than I would like... For sure, there are alot of hurdles...

It is our opinion that any transactions that are being done by the DWR with third parties are relatively short dated..  1 month, 2 month etc.. but we will keep you posted as we move forward.

Barry,

Interstate Gas Services, on behalf of the DWR, will be soliciting bids for
gas supply.  We are currently contemplating limited gas purchases, and would
like to get a GISB in place.  We would like to do a quick follow up in
regards to the status of the GISB contract between yourselves and the
Department of Water Resources.  If your legal department has any questions
or concerns, please contact Mark Baldwin of Interstate Gas Services at
925-243-0350.

To address any credit concerns you may have, the department is currently
preparing a complete credit package which we will forward to you upon its
completion.

Again, please do not hesitate to call.

Subject:	Heidi Dubose Performance Issues


As a follow up to the written warning on August 14, 2001 to Heidi Dubose regarding her poor job performance I would like to submit the following commentary:

Heidi's phone coverage is still very inadequate.  I have had two discussions with her in the last 2 weeks regarding this.  She consistently does not take messages properly.  Most of the time all she tells us is the person's first name and that they are holding.  When she does get the last name it is incorrect at least half of the time.  She rarely gets the company name, and when she does it is incorrect or mispelled.

The kitchen areas continue to be unkept and dirty.  She has started to put the dishes in the dishwasher but she rarely unloads them.  If she does it is after they have been in there for days.

We continue to run out of office supplies and she does not consistently monitor the office needs.


In summary, Heidi's performance has improved some since August 14 but that improvement is not seen on a consistent basis.  She has not elevated her performance to the level which is required to manage the office.

Subject:	Buffalo Power Company LLC - Gas Turbine Power Plant Project 

ENA and Crestone (Northern Border's non-regulated affiliate) met with a group of developers and Joe Meyer, Secretary of State in Wyoming, who have proposed to build a 200 MW power plant (expandable to 500 MW) in the Powder River basin of Wyoming.  Their ""angle"" is that the existing utility, Powder River Electric Coop, cannot meet the demand for electricity and the necessary distribution infrastructure to maintain the pace of development in the Coal Bed Methane BOOM that is happening in the basin.  

As you may or may not know, Enron has been very involved in this Coal Bed Methane play since 1998.  ENA is the largest purchaser of 3rd party gas in the basin and Crestone is the largest non-producer gathering company in the basin.  Crestone has a gathering trunkline located near their proposed site.  The developers will be filing a petition to remove this area from the COOP's certificated territory in the next couple of weeks.

There are obviously regulatory issues revolving around their ability to gain access to this ""retail"" market and the project would not be economically feasible as a merchant plant in the wholesale market.  However, they seem to have some political backing.

These developers recognize that they need Enron's assistance in developing this project on three main fronts:

1.  Power Marketing and Project development
2.  Gas Supplies and Pipeline access
3.  Regulatory and Transmission expertise

Given the fact that Joe Meyer is the early favorite to be the next Wyoming Governor and we are trying to work well with the State of Wyoming, and we have a natural competitive advantage in this market from a gas supply and pipeline perspective, I would like to pursue this opportunity a little further.

Therefore, I am wondering if I could get a Sr. Commercial Power Representative and a Regulatory Representative (Steve Walton would be good since he will be on the Wyoming Energy Commission), to attend a meeting in Denver with myself and the Crestone representatives sometime in the next 2 weeks.

Please give me a call and I can elaborate on the opportunity or answer your questions.  I don't want to make this email a novel!

Thanks a lot.

I was just talking to counsel in Phoenix who informed me that a number of planned merchant generators in Arizona were in danger of being killed by the Arizona Corporation Commission.

Talked to Mark.

First thing he has to do is convince Davis' lawyers that his companies' client list (which includes TW) shouldn't conflict him out of working on DWR gas deals.
He should have that figured out by this week--sounds like he may have to make some decisions about his current client list and working for DWR.
I told him that we'd like to sit down as soon as possible to discuss opportunities for us to help out DWR with its gas needs.
He said that he'd be happy to do that, once he's got all conflict issues worked out with the Governor's office.
He's going to get back to me to set up a meeting; and if I don't hear from him by Monday/Tuesday of next week, I'll call him back to set up a meeting.
I'm assuming that you'd be part of that meeting?
I asked him what sort of deals they're working on. As you likely know, some of the contracts permit DWR to either 1) provide gas to the plant providing DWR power under the power contract or 2) manage the plant's fuel supply.  So they're looking to get ""soup-to-nuts"" supply service for those contracts that include a fuel-supply option.

Best,
Jeff"

The issue that has surfaced is that the COF is only applicable to originated transactions and not to deals done at the desk level.  This has primary concerns for the mid-market effort.  Due to the noise that was occurring around this topic Joe Deffner suggested that we all get together with him to discuss.  He is available 10/3/01 before 11:00.  Are you interested and available at 9:30 am (today) to participate ?

Mr. Tycholiz:

I represent SCE's Energy Supply and Marketing Department with respect to
the above-referenced subject.  It is my understanding that the account
number in Section 2 of the Transaction Agreement Regarding Collateral
(""Agreement"") is incorrect.  I propose that the parties correct the error
by lining out the incorrect number and inserting by hand the correct one.
I have drafted and attached a letter agreement reflecting that intention.

discuss further.  Thank you.

Mark and Barry

I have talked to Crestone about backing us in a Northern Border transportation deal.  Basically they are on board, however I have not shown them any economics.  What I believe needs to take place is to identify Northern Border shippers who would be willing to release their capacity.  Once we are able to put the capacity release economics together, which will be driven by the Northern Border shippers, we will be able to 
show Crestone a deal.  I do not have any potential parties willing to release Northern Border capacity.  I have talked to the Central desk about this opportunity, they informed me that they had no interest in this type of an arrangement.  I personally believe we can manage ENA's current Northern Border position more efficiently but have been unable to convince others of this.  Any ideas you can provide would be helpful.

Enron Venture Capitalism
You have two cows.
You sell three of them to your publicly listed company, using letters of
credit
opened by your brother-in-law at the bank, then execute a debt/equity
swap
with
an associated general offer so that you get all four cows back, with a
tax
exemption for five cows.  The milk rights of the six cows are
transferred
via an
intermediary to a Cayman Island company secretly owned by the majority
shareholder who sells the rights to all seven cows back to your listed
company.
The annual report says the company owns eight cows, with an option on
one
more.

Barry,

It was a pleasure to discuss the upcoming gas supply needs of DWR and the
potential supply options that Enron may be able to provide . I am interested
in further exploring the discounted transportation/ supply program we
briefly discussed at this week's meeting. As for the payables, DWR is
following standard payment terms; the latter of 10 days after receipt of
invoice or the 25th of the month following delivery. DWR would not agree to
accelerating payments. Additionally, please be advised that DWR would be
contemplating relatively short term transactions with Enron at this time. If
you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call.

Mark Baldwin, IGS.

rumours of your demise are greatly exageerated !

I'm surviving - just finished an NEB Hearing yesterday on our bypass
pipeline (bypasses NGTL in the Med Hat area). The week before that we had
this little meltdown of our strategic alliance partner which caused a few
sleepless nights and much reading of the contracts...but we survived.

karen is over at progas and seems to be enjoying it.

when are you coming up to the great white north ? let me know and we should
have a beer and shot some pool.

As I am not involved in the daily operations behind this deal, I will need your input in order to respond to this request.  As I have indicated, the frequency of cuts has caused tremedous concern and Citizens is considering walking away from this deal.  They need assurance that this gas is going to flow in order to continue.  Do we need to have a meeting?  And when can I expect a response from the desk?

As I have discussed with you, Citizens is concerned about the frequency of upstream supply issues that have resulted in the recent cuts in the deliveries to the Griffith power plant.  Based on the information I have received, the reasons for these cuts have not risen to the level of Force Majeure, which as you know is the only event that would excuse performance under our contract for firm delivery of gas.  Citizens therefore requests that Enron respond to Citizens in writing with a descriptions of the steps Enron is taking to insure that there is not a continuation of these contract performance issues into the future. Your prompt attention to this matter is appreciated.  "

I just wanted to touch base with you on the cash trade that you intermediated between Stephane and Cascade this morning. I don't really feel that it is Stephane's responsibility to manage Cascades price risk and I think that you are out of line for accusing him of running over your customer.

Theresa,   I agree.   I will accept Aeco DI from Tenaska for gas not taken
on Sept16/01 @ NIT.
 
Cliff,   please arrange to invoice ENA for price difference (contract price
- Aeco DI - fuel to Harper )  for gas not taken - it's about a US$0.28
/mmbtu touch.    I recognize that some spill more than this at lunch time,
but we should proceed anyway.

On 9/15/01, Enron failed to take full volume at Harper on T1134F.  This
backed up to Aeco.  Tenaska is planning on purchasing this gas at Aeco daily
for 9/16/01.  The volume not taken is 1,917 dth at Harper.  This equates to
2,103 gj's @NIT.  I don't know why Enron did not pull all of the gas.
Please let me know if you do not agree with selling to Tenaska.  
If you have any questions, please let me know.  Thanks Theresa

In all cases except for Hallwood, ENA Denver has a relationship with these customers that primarily covers their physical business, we would like to expand that business to cover their Derivative business as well.  The list is based on priority.  We would be willing to cover them for their West Gas business only.  Fred could continue to cover their East, Central and Oil/Liquids business.

Hello Barry,

My name is Todd Neugebauer and I am a manager in EBS Wholesale Origination in Europe.  I came over here as an associate in February and was promoted in June.  I am looking to move back into one of our more core areas and Ted Bland recommended I speak to you, or someone in your group.  If you have a need, I am going to be in Houston late next week and would be able to meet then to discuss any opportunities.

Regards,

Feudalism
You have two cows.
Your lord takes some of the milk.

----------

Fascism
You have two cows.
The government takes both, hires you to take care of them and sells you the
milk.

----------

Pure Communism
You have two cows.
Your neighbours help take care of them and you all share the milk.

----------

Applied Communism
You have two cows.
You must take care of them, but the government takes all the milk.

----------

Totalitarianism
You have two cows.
The government takes them both and denies they ever existed. Milk is banned.

----------

Pure Democracy
You have two cows.
You and your neighbours decide who gets the milk.

----------

Representative Democracy
You have two cows.
Your neighbours pick someone to tell you who gets the milk.

Mexican Democracy
You have two cows.
The government takes both and drafts you into the army.


----------

European Democracy
You have two cows.
The EU commission decides which regulations for feeding and milking apply.
If
there aren't any, they invent some. They pay you not to milk the cows.
They take both cows, shoot one, milk the other and pour the milk down the
drain.
They then require you to fill out forms accounting for the missing cows.


----------

American Democracy
The government promises to give you two cows, if you vote for it.
After the election, the president is impeached for speculating in cow
futures.
The press dubs the affair ""cowgate,"" but supports the president.
The cows sue you for breach of contract.
Your legal bills exceed your annual income.
You settle out of court and declare bankruptcy.


----------


Capitalism
You have two cows.
You sell one and buy a bull.
Your herd multiplies, and the economy grows. You sell them and retire on the
income.


----------

Enron Venture Capitalism
You have two cows.
You sell three of them to your publicly listed company, using letters of
credit
opened by your brother-in-law at the bank, then execute a debt/equity swap
with
an associated general offer so that you get all four cows back, with a tax
exemption for five cows.  The milk rights of the six cows are transferred
via an
intermediary to a Cayman Island company secretly owned by the majority
shareholder who sells the rights to all seven cows back to your listed
company.
The annual report says the company owns eight cows, with an option on one
more.

Barry, what did you do to the company!?  Listen, sorry to hear about the 
problems at ENRON.  What a strange turn of events.  It is pretty bizarre 
after 10 years of ENRON being the model for other companies on how to 
succeed in the energy industry. What's your take on why it happened?  We get 
a little bit of news down here but we're a little out of touch.

How are you taking it?  Are you pissed? Do you feel like you squeezed pretty 
much what you wanted out of the job? What's the next thing for Barry Tic?  
Well, like all of life's curve-balls there is always something sweet in the 
next pitch you get (jeez, how sappy is that!).  Anyway, hope you're taking 
it all with the good nature you always do.

Hey, maybe this will give you the chance to take a holiday in Ecuador 
(Christmas turkey at our house this year?).  Say hi to Kim for us, drop me a 
line as soon as you can (a better address to reach me is craigh@ph.com.ec).  
Sorry I haven't sent a note before this but you know we are always rooting 
for you.

Your pal, Craig.

My general message, unless you have something to add or subtract, will be: ""lots has gone on at both companies, makes sense to get together to meet your team to talk about gas and power - probably is more we can be doing together, etc. meeting in late Nov/early Dec"".

We are planning on joining Crestone for a combined Denver Christmas party.  The cost for our share will be approximately $1,000.  I know it is not cheap, but I think it is an important signal and morale booster which is critical at this time.  We have a long way to go in this deal."

I am not going to hard trade the buyers at this point until we know for sure Suncor is there.. 

So, can you pls advise. 

I would suggest we get Suncor to give you a ""Stand Still"" for the rest of this week which includes a firm number ( or better ) that they will sell capacity for. By the way, this number needs to be close to zero as there is not much left over.


Current economics.... approx $400,000 Bid on the table, plus ENA holds option Apr 02 - oct 02 to put capacity to buyer.  Under this structre Suncor keeps capacity until Apr. 02. There are no liquids conversations being conducted at this time and pending structure may not be.

None of the financial markets support premium payments ( for any term ).

I would like to take the next step with them and assuming we get paper executed for ECC and ENA ( which is pending).... I want to give them TRADE ACCESS TO EOL.  

Cumulative unsecured exposure would be about $300,000/day. ( estimated ) and  I would try to get the payments from them to us made on the 5th business day vs the 25th business day following delivery. Our master will give us rights for reasonable financial assurances but not definative collateral threshold amount, infact we should keep this at zero for both sides until the air clears. 

All transactions will come through EOL and the products being sold by ENA, ECC will be cash or rest of month, AECO, Sumas, Malin or PG&E Citygate.

The bottom line on this is do we want to enter into Gas related cash transactions that increase of exposure on a receivables basis to PG&E.  Commercially, I believe they are someone we want to do business with and we can increase deal flow on EOL for some Canadian and U.S. products. I do not think we are in a position today to ask for pre-pays.

I believe that your skillset would be a positive addition to the West Gas origination group. We can provide for you a new learning experience by becoming a key component of the team. You will be asked to provide real time modeling, DCF, research on wellhead to burner tip strategies. You will learn a tremendous amount about the Natural gas business with exposure stemming from the wellhead to the burner tip. Some areas include, commodity price risk structures, risk management initiatives, financial and physical markets, structured products and transportation related initiatives.  

Please use this note as a formal offer of employment. I would like you to start as soon as you can.. ( next 2 weeks) and will leave this for you to think about until the end of day on Monday. 

Pls contact me directly if there are any questions regarding this note or any other matters. 

regards, Barry Tycholiz

We estimated 27,700 (including 3,000 for airfare for Enron people)
We spent 25, 096 (not including airfare or fishing or anything that was put on credit cards)

I will need to get an actual cost for the airfare and anything that was expensed to be able to give you a complete cost of the event.  I will contact Jessica to get this information from her.  I will then include it and send it back to you.

The bill has not been paid. As soon as I got it I put the list together for you.   I am sending it to accounts payable to get paid tomorrow.

I'll get everything to you as soon as I get it.

Barry,

As promised, here are some of the current redeployment candidates that have a marketing/structuring/trading background for consideration concerning your West Origination opening.  I believe that you have seen Jim Lowe before and expressed some limited interest in him.  The other candidates are most likely new to you.

Let me know if you would like to pursue any of these redeployed employees.


 << File: Alok Garg.doc >>  << File: Mark Dypiangco.doc >>  << File: Laura Odenthal.doc >>  << File: Audrey O'Neil.doc >>  << File: Jim Lowe.doc >> 

Also, I spoke with Mark McConnell today, and he mentioned that he had accepted the offer to join the Transwestern group of ETS.  He primary motivation for selection of this option was his desire to work with asset deals.  As we know, given EWS ""asset light"" approach to deal making, this option would be difficult to fulfill within the West Origination group.  However, he mentioned that he was very impressed with your group, and short of the asset piece maintained a high interest in your open position.

Regards,
Todd Peikert"

Barry,

Here is a list and the status of the customers I'm dealing with concerning the El Paso Transportation;



Texaco-I have sent the presentation to my rep (Mike Duval) he is trying to arrange a telephone conversation with the appropriate parties within Texaco
Devon-I have sent the presentation to Devon and have had discussions on the subject.  They seem to be somewhat interested but will be slow to move.  They have committed all their San Juan production until April 2002.
Amoco- Talked to my rep who referred me on to the San Juan trader, these two are not very interested, however Dave Fuller has a contact at Amoco who seems to like the theory.
Reliant-I have had multiple conversations with these guys they are not very interested in this capacity.


I will continue to work with Dave on Amoco, as well as Devon and Texaco.  As new information develops I will pass it on.

Ray... seems like its been a while since we met in San Fransisco, ....  and of course so much has happened since then. 

I have been talking with our in house legal and with Canada and I know Eric and yourself have also been talking. I believe that the door has been pushed open a little and if everyone tries to get these agreements cleaned up  and executed that PG&E and Enron ( Canada & US ) can start to transact.

With that being said, there are two areas which I would like to refresh from our discussions..

1.  Did you give any further thought to the utilization of Daily gas sales as a collateral.. I truly believe that this vehicle is a very efficient,easy way for PG&E to enhance the credit with ENA and once we have a 30 day bucket... we can get you trading access to EOL.  Lot's of details to work out, but I would like to keep this discussion at the forefront. I can send the details of how this proposal would work if required. ( let me know ) 

2.  As discussed, ENA holds some 5 year El Paso capacity. I am looking to assign this capacity and possibly and would like to investigate your supply requirements and possible alternatives such that you can consider our capacity.  

I trust all is well and look forward to talking to you soon.

BT - Pardon my spelling.... I like to think its more of a typing issue, however.  

Regarding uranium:

Prices for oxide (mined material) are up from a low of $7.10 last December to a new high this month of $9.20 (still low by historical standards).  Perhaps more important though, fuel cycle components (conversion & enrichment) are very strong.  Conversion at $5.00 up from $2.20, enrichment at $105.00 up from $80.00.  These fuel cycle components are required to turn ore into fuel. - DF

It is VERY important that trading and marketing are aware of the hedging activities in a very timely fashion so however we need to ensure that happens will be my plan.

Barry,
Sorry for not getting back to you. The Power MTM positions are approx $570,000 and all related to physical positions with a total Net Power  position of approx $1.2MM. I have been working with Beverly Ikeda of Puget on the issues and so far so good. Puget is going to deliver a $10MM  Letter of Credit to cover the financial positions. From our conversations, her traders do not anticipate hedging any further and really only need access to short term EOL business. In addition, she and I discussed the needs of bilateral contracts with margining rights to prevent a similar situation from occurring in the future. 

Thanks,

Subject: Natural Gas Origination


Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John"

Barry,

My name is Alisha Mahabir and I have been working on negotiating the MGI/ENA GISB.  I have been in contact with Lourdes Cervantes at MGI; her phone number is 525-232-5990.  There are still a few issues left to be resolved before we can proceed with the execution of this document.  Per Geral Nemec's request, I will outline these changes as they are addressed in Exhibit B to the GISB that was sent over by Lourdes.

Initially I want to note that some changes must be made to the front page of the GISB.  MGI has previously agreed to allow ENA to be the confirming party under Section 2.5.  Additionally, there have been a few problems with allowing payment to be made on the 30th day of the month.  It appears that MGI has been construing this provision broadly so as to make payment on the 2nd day of March after a short month in February.  Thus, we would like Section 7.2 to read ""30th day or, for the Month of February, on the last day of the Month"".  

As for Exhibit B, the changes are as follows:

#4 The words ""or interruptible"" should be deleted from this provision.  The interruptible language conflicts with the ability to do 30 day firm deals under this contract.

#11 This provision deals with when notices are deemed received.  The provision as written provides that notice by first class mail is deemed received 2 business days after mailing.  MGI would like to change this to allow for receipt to mean actual receipt.  Lourdes told me that she will check to see whether the change can be stricken or at least to extend 2 business days to 3 business days.

#12 (a) MGI has agreed to strike the term ""letter"" from the requirement that the Parent issue a guarantee should doubt arise as to Enron's ability to pay.  
      (b)  Originally the GISB provides that a contract can be terminated without prior notice should certain conditions be met.  MGI wants to change this to require the parties to provide 48 hours notice.  Lourdes told me that she would check to see whether this could be changed to 24 hours prior notice.

#16  The language designating ICC is acceptable, however any redundant language should be stricken.

If this memo is at all unclear, please feel free to call me.  My extension is 52722.  

Alisha Mahabir"

You have two cows.
The government takes both, hires you to take care of them and sells you the
milk.

----------

Pure Communism
You have two cows.
Your neighbours help take care of them and you all share the milk.

----------

Applied Communism
You have two cows.
You must take care of them, but the government takes all the milk.

----------

Totalitarianism
You have two cows.
The government takes them both and denies they ever existed. Milk is banned.

----------

Pure Democracy
You have two cows.
You and your neighbours decide who gets the milk.

----------

Representative Democracy
You have two cows.
Your neighbours pick someone to tell you who gets the milk.

Mexican Democracy
You have two cows.
The government takes both and drafts you into the army.


----------

European Democracy
You have two cows.
The EU commission decides which regulations for feeding and milking apply.
If
there aren't any, they invent some. They pay you not to milk the cows.
They take both cows, shoot one, milk the other and pour the milk down the
drain.
They then require you to fill out forms accounting for the missing cows.


----------

American Democracy
The government promises to give you two cows, if you vote for it.
After the election, the president is impeached for speculating in cow
futures.
The press dubs the affair ""cowgate,"" but supports the president.
The cows sue you for breach of contract.
Your legal bills exceed your annual income.
You settle out of court and declare bankruptcy.

You have two cows.
You sell one and buy a bull.
Your herd multiplies, and the economy grows. You sell them and retire on the
income.


----------

Enron Venture Capitalism
You have two cows.
You sell three of them to your publicly listed company, using letters of
credit
opened by your brother-in-law at the bank, then execute a debt/equity swap
with
an associated general offer so that you get all four cows back, with a tax
exemption for five cows.  The milk rights of the six cows are transferred
via an
intermediary to a Cayman Island company secretly owned by the majority
shareholder who sells the rights to all seven cows back to your listed
company.
The annual report says the company owns eight cows, with an option on one
more.

Jeff, thanks again for attending the discussions with DWR.

Do you have any recon.... on exactly which plants DWR has the right to bring the fuel on. As Mark indicated, it was about 1/3 of their exposure, and most of that was in the south service area, but I am very interested in the actual facilities and whom used to bring fuel to them or run the units.'

There is a zero sum game on fuel... but the landscape changes depending on who buys it and how they buy it! 

Any thoughts.

Subject:	El Paso's Bid to Hike Export Capacity Opposed 

NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
published : September 20, 2001
El Paso's Bid to Hike Export Capacity Opposed 
Southwest local distribution utilities and municipal distributors have called on FERC to reject, or convene a technical conference to consider, El Paso Natural Gas' application to boost export capacity on the Samalayuca Lateral by about 100 MMcf/d to meet natural gas demand in northern Mexico. They argue that such action would deprive existing El Paso customers of already-tight capacity on the pipeline's South Mainline. 
There are a number of ongoing cases at the Commission addressing the limited capacity on the El Paso system, and its capacity-allocation procedures, the distributors pointed out. ""Yet...El Paso proposes to allow a unilateral reallocation of 100,000 Mcf./d of capacity to serve customers outside the United States without fully disclosing from which customer the capacity will come and its likely impact on all these pending matters,"" said Southern Union Gas Co. The utility asked the Commission to convene a technical conference. 
Southwest Gas Corp. and the El Paso Municipal Customer Group said they were concerned the proposed increase in the lateral's capacity may ""adversely affect"" them and other customers because capacity on the South Mainline would be needed to move the additional export load. FERC ""should not approve increased export capacity without a corresponding increase in mainline capacity"" on El Paso's system, they said. 
Southwest and the municipal distributors urged the Commission to either: 1) reject the El Paso application outright; 2) in the alternative, set the case for hearing to assess the impact on existing customers; or 3) absent rejection or hearing, defer consideration of the application until other pending cases related to the level of capacity on El Paso are resolved. 
In its application, El Paso asked FERC for the go-ahead to increase the maximum daily export capacity on the lateral by about one-third to 308 MMcf/d to correspond with the ""rapid development"" of the gas infrastructure in the northern Mexico state of Chihuahua. It said it already had entered into a long-term agreement for the entire proposed increase of 100 MMcf/d of export capacity with MGI Supply Ltd (See Daily GPI, Aug. 31 <d20010831e.html>). "

Yes, it could be used - with of course excessive costs to buy.

Subject: Contractual Obligations Associated with Long Term Pipeline Contract



Greetings Steve:

We have had many inquiries regarding our transportation agreements, specifically PGT, Kern River and El Paso.  

Most pressing is PGT's request to market capacity on our behalf. Although I do not believe we need to have PGT perform this function, I do believe we could mitigate some demand charge exposure for ""the estate"".  

Are you available to meet with Barry and I first thing tomorrow morning? We need to have an answer for PGT's request. We need to know what the contractual rights are for 1) the pipeline when a shipper declares bankruptcy and 2) our ability to mitigate demand charge exposure by releasing capacity on a short term basis (month at a time?).

Better yet, can we unilaterally turn capacity back to any of these pipes or do we need to reach some type of court approved settlement?

Obviously, we have many questions. Please advise of your ability to meet ASAP.

Thanks,

Stephanie

As you can see, this distribution protects your rate base against a rising price environment and partially floats with market prices as they move down.  The distribution ( fixed price vs floating ) may move up a percent or two in relation to the outright price desk that we face today ( relative to the historical numbers) but those iterations can be made as required.

Pls review and we can discuss at your convenience.

Also, as discussed, I am looking for ways to enhance our ability to transact with you on gas structures but in light of the overall credit positions that may be difficult.  With that being said however, I do believe that we can stream some structures to the physical contracts in gas and ensure that from the physical point of view ENA and SPPC are both protected and I would like to pursue this with you. One area that I would like to start with to have SPPC sell ENA physical gas ( 30,000/40,000/day) against a physical gas daily related price.  Once I have accumulated a payables position, we inherently create a secured line without having to change any of the contracts/paper currently in place.  I am also sure this will require further discussions and look forward to catching up with you soonest.

Attached are the latest based on our discussions.  I couldn't redline the Capacity Release Agreement, so I am only sending a clean version.  I would still make a general caveat, that we still need to do a final review of the gathering agreement.  This could add to the Transaction Agreement.

Subject:	PGT Expansion 2003 - Info

As you guys know the 2003 PGT expansion plans are supposed to be 230,000/day. The landscape of the shippers list is ever changing... Rumors of PPL pulling out 85,000/day to Malin and Stanfield is unconfirmed ( we are trying to validate)... and potentially Avista pulling out as they have been downgraded... they hold 35,000/day in 2003. Combined this is almost half of the planned expansion. 

Although not confirmed the bottom line is as the 03 shippers back out the expansion it becomes compromised and ultimately I believe the 2002 expansion and 2003 expansion start to blend together. As you guys know the 2002 shippers lists of 211,000 / day is made up 2 shippers Calpine 35,000/day and Newport Gen 175,000/day and this expansion has it's own issues.  

As we know more about shippers moving around I will pass on... pls do same.

This marketing effort is at the core of what ENA - Wholesale Gas is trying to promote and any third part mix into this effort does not help. 

Regardless as to where we are at in our marketing efforts and success to date in these efforts.... Utility business is a ENA customer and I consider them a primary wholesale customer.

I have not discussed this is anyone at EES but in my discussions with my peers was led to believe that this issues was tabled with you already and my comments would support your conversations with EES on our behalf.

Pls advise if you need to discuss or require anything from me.

Pure Democracy

You and your neighbours decide who gets the milk.

Your neighbours pick someone to tell you who gets the milk.

Mexican Democracy
You have two cows.
The government takes both and drafts you into the army.


----------

European Democracy
You have two cows.
The EU commission decides which regulations for feeding and milking apply.
If
there aren't any, they invent some. They pay you not to milk the cows.
They take both cows, shoot one, milk the other and pour the milk down the
drain.
They then require you to fill out forms accounting for the missing cows.

The government promises to give you two cows, if you vote for it.
After the election, the president is impeached for speculating in cow

Enron Venture Capitalism
You have two cows.
You sell three of them to your publicly listed company, using letters of
credit
opened by your brother-in-law at the bank, then execute a debt/equity swap
with
an associated general offer so that you get all four cows back, with a tax
exemption for five cows.  The milk rights of the six cows are transferred
via an
intermediary to a Cayman Island company secretly owned by the majority
shareholder who sells the rights to all seven cows back to your listed
company.
The annual report says the company owns eight cows, with an option on one
more.

Also, where do you think AEC, Talisman and CNRL will be to take permanent assignment of this pipe effective asap... thus changing the deal delivery point around..( an the credit situation). 

Included in the shuffle will be the liquids obligations, nominations, ( ENA /ECC can still act as the agent) but most importantly the thing we need to transfer over is the pipe obligation on PGT..... stat !!!

1. The on again off again PGT assignment of 10,000 MMBTU per day out of Nov. 2002. appears to have surfaced from our counter party again and under the assumption you are still interested I will forward to you latest offer once we have FIRMED it up with the third party. 

2. It is my understanding that you own El Paso - PG&E Topock capacity until May 31, 2003.  ENA has some of the same capacity and is prepared to offer this into the market place from the period June 1, 2003 - May 30, 2006. ( with the renewal rights), PLUS some sort of "" Payment "" from ENA to SMUD.  Rather than renew your existing capacity at full tolls, this is a way to pick up transport below the normal tariff and retain renewal rights after 2006. 

Pls advise if either of these points capture your interest.

There may be a handful of small QFs which have not returned but I would say the a majority of the QFs are back on line and are being paid for what they generate on a go forward basis.  Right now the SCE QFs are negotiating with SCE on 2 major points:  when will they be paid for the outstanding receivables (est. at $1.3 B for SCE and about $1.0 B for PG&E)  and when will the 5 yr fixed price SRAC of 5.37 cents/kw apply for those that have selected this option.  Right now SCE appears to be indicating that they will be paying the receivable sometime around June/July of 2002 and that the 5.37 price would apply at that time or as much as 4 months after that.  The logic is that they are trying to indicate that the MOU, if it had been passed, would not have applied at least until that time.

Mike, have the QF's been paid for the power they were selling to the utilities.  I have not heard much about that and was wondering if these payments were all part of the Bond issue.? Are the QF's generating power today?

Dear West,

We talked briefly on Monday about our commitment to a full work day at Enron.  If you are in the office, then please be prepared to contribute to the group for a full day.  Our schedule now calls for critical communication in the afternoons.  We need to know that each employee will be here every day to create the consistency needed to outperform the rest of the market.  

We want to remain as flexible as possible with all traders when it comes to an emergency, but remember that you have a commitment to Enron to contribute a full work day.  

Please organize your vacation on the west desk calendar with Ina and coordinate any early afternoon departures with Ina and myself.  Also, prepare to have your markets covered when you leave the office early.

Sincerely,

Mike

Barry,

As promised, here are some of the current redeployment candidates that have a marketing/structuring/trading background for consideration concerning your West Origination opening.  I believe that you have seen Jim Lowe before and expressed some limited interest in him.  The other candidates are most likely new to you.

Let me know if you would like to pursue any of these redeployed employees.


 << File: Alok Garg.doc >>  << File: Mark Dypiangco.doc >>  << File: Laura Odenthal.doc >>  << File: Audrey O'Neil.doc >>  << File: Jim Lowe.doc >> 

Also, I spoke with Mark McConnell today, and he mentioned that he had accepted the offer to join the Transwestern group of ETS.  He primary motivation for selection of this option was his desire to work with asset deals.  As we know, given EWS ""asset light"" approach to deal making, this option would be difficult to fulfill within the West Origination group.  However, he mentioned that he was very impressed with your group, and short of the asset piece maintained a high interest in your open position.

Regards,
Todd Peikert"

Subject:	ENE comps

Grant, ENE trades at 7x 2001 expected recurring earnings and 0.9 times book value.  This is far lower than a quick industry average of 15.5 times 2001 expected earnings and 2.8 times current book value (industry includes Duke, EL Paso, Williams, Dynegy, Kinder Morgan, and Aquila).  I think what these ratios demonstrate is the risk of the unknown that is being priced into ENE.  For example the current price to book seems like a suspect ratio to use for ENE given that it is unclear what is on our books and what else needs to be written down.  If you look at ENE on a price to earnings after non-recurring items for 2001 it looks far less attractive at 22.9 times.  If you take ENE's earnings after ""non-recurring"" items and slap on the industry average multiple of 15.5 times ENE's share price is $8.51 (ouch).  Now obviously not everything in the non-recurring events are actually recurring but there is talk of some wholesale losses being buried in the ""non-recurring"" loss.

ENE's long-term debt to equity is 0.9 times but if you include all the off balance sheet leverage and the leverage inherent in our trading business the true number is significantly higher than 0.9 times.  On a positive note the ENE's debt is trading higher today (price not yield).

Here is a spreadsheet from Bloomberg with the S&P pipelines sub sector P/Es, and P/Bs. and dividend per share (ENE's is 4%, nothing like a share price falling by 85% to get that div yield up).  I have also attached the latest Wall Street Journal article touting Berkshire, Royal Dutch, and GE as potential suitors (do you think Buffet can understand ENE?).

Hope this helps

Do you have any recon.... on exactly which plants DWR has the right to bring the fuel on. As Mark indicated, it was about 1/3 of their exposure, and most of that was in the south service area, but I am very interested in the actual facilities and whom used to bring fuel to them or run the units.'

There is a zero sum game on fuel... but the landscape changes depending on who buys it and how they buy it!

Mike, I have asked INA to check into the coordination of a tour for our group( trading and marketing) prior to the official move in.

I would like to restrict the attendees to the commercial staff, traders and marketers... and this will give everyone a chance to see the new digs.. and then I would also like to suggest that we all slide out to the local watering hole for a drink... it is long overdue.. 

Any suggestions on a date, perhaps 3:00 - 3:30 for a tour.. then out for a drink... what about next tues....

Also, Louise has reviewed the headcount plan submitted for 2002 and asked that we reduce the West Origination count by one.  The attached file shows what was initially submitted.  If you will let me know what position to eliminate, I will make the necessary adjustments.

 Well, I am glad you made it home from Denver. It must have been a little hairy around there Sept. 11. Were you in the air already or just getting ready to leave when it all happened. Does any of this change you plans for Xmas?
 
We have not made a decision yet. The reason for that is, we can't make a 'good' decision until we know whether we will get to the U.S. or not for the tour. It is that up in the air. If things work out for the worst, we will not recover from this and will be forced to sell the van. It will be the end of the band obviously. Hopeful y that will not happen. My problem is that I don't want o get in any situation that might cause you and I any problems. This business that you and I do together is for the band. The band is just not that important to let it get in the way of family. I won't let it get in the way of Michele and I ..........so. I just want to make a good decision on this. I( guess for you it does not make too much difference either way, does it? I mean either you will get the balance paid or a payment in November. Sorry I did not get back to you about it, it's just that I really didn't have an answer. How's Kim. I guess you know Marge got a dog.

Subject:	Discussion with Rick Hawley

Just got off the phone with Rick Hawley--Puget's CFO.  He was very cordial and indicated the company was interested in talking with us.  We had a fairly open discussion of who we should contact.  In the end, he suggested that we call Bill Gaines, VP Energy Supply.  He said that as CFO he is head of the Risk Management Committee and that anything that was discussed with Bill would go through his committee.  I highlighted the notion that we were interested in talking about services that could be helpful to their risk management efforts and that would be beneficial to both of our companies.  

By the way, at the beginning of the call, I made clear that we were not talking about total outsourcing.  

He didn't immediately respond, but in the context of our discussion re:  who to talk to he stated that we should talk to him if we wanted to have a more strategic discussion on outsourcing.  Then he said something to the effect of ""of course, we're not at all interested in a more comprehensive outsourcing product.""

Bill's number is 425.462.3145.  He said that we can tell Bill, Rick suggested we call him directly.  "

Todd, further to your voice message. Yes, I did meet in person with Robert Ayers, the meeting went well, and he was going to contact me on Friday. He was considering another offer ( a different co.) and wanted to make a decision this week. As such I committed to informing him as to whether or not an offer will be made to him.

At this time, I am not going to make an offer and will advise him as such upon my next contact. Although he has some good qualities I am going to continue in my search.

Per your request, here is a copy of my resume.  As I mentioned on our call, I am planning to be in Houston later next week and would be available to meet with members of the group then (possibility I may be in all week).  If that doesn't work, I am definitely able to speak by phone.

Thank you for meeting with us this week. Speaking on behalf of Enron U.S. I know there was some very good clarification, information and hopefully action required by all the parties.

I look forward to working through some transportation/supply structures and will contact you next week to discuss.

I have also met with our legal team to discuss the commercial and legal issues related to the GISB ( under 30 day firm agreement ) and need to discuss the details with you to see if we can get the proper paper completed. I have also raised a draft Master Firm agreement ( to handle term structures) and will begin to review this for early next week also.

I would probably drop the range volume and go with a specific amount... 10,000 - 25,000 instead of up to 200,000 as I am sure there is no way they will get that high.

Subject:	Discussion with Rick Hawley

Just got off the phone with Rick Hawley--Puget's CFO.  He was very cordial and indicated the company was interested in talking with us.  We had a fairly open discussion of who we should contact.  In the end, he suggested that we call Bill Gaines, VP Energy Supply.  He said that as CFO he is head of the Risk Management Committee and that anything that was discussed with Bill would go through his committee.  I highlighted the notion that we were interested in talking about services that could be helpful to their risk management efforts and that would be beneficial to both of our companies.  

By the way, at the beginning of the call, I made clear that we were not talking about total outsourcing.  

He didn't immediately respond, but in the context of our discussion re:  who to talk to he stated that we should talk to him if we wanted to have a more strategic discussion on outsourcing.  Then he said something to the effect of ""of course, we're not at all interested in a more comprehensive outsourcing product.""

Bill's number is 425.462.3145.  He said that we can tell Bill, Rick suggested we call him directly.  "

Timely note, and once again I am already hard at work prospecting for you up here.
They are getting ready to drill CBM this fall. I've been meeting with them on this and actually set them up to do a deal with ATS on production/revenue/lease acctg in the US (next mtg Oct 9 in Calgary).  I gave them a presentation a few weeks ago on the general things we and ATS can do for them in Denver/Dallas.  I want to send them something more specific about all we can do in the Rockies on the gas mktg side.  I'll also build in some data on Hanover for them so will draw that from Producer One.
Can I get some general slides about all the good things Mark and the gang do in Denver.
Timing is next few days.  I'd like to get this to them by sometime Friday if possible (not the end of the world if it's early next week).

I think fuller was doing some leg work also.

Do you think there are any displacement issues that they may be forced to adhere to that would no allow them to shift flows?

Also, are you able to replicate the delivery point off of JP to make this happen?

Tych,

Just wondering if you guys have talked to any storage guys in the PNW about storage deals for this Nov to next summer ect. The market is essentially saying that JP storage is worthless for this winter (Nov-Dec) and I don't think that should be the case. I think there is free money on the table for someone like Puget or Avista to roll their scheduled storage withdrawls to next summer. Let me know if you have any thoughts.

I have been talking with our in house legal and with Canada and I know Eric and yourself have also been talking. I believe that the door has been pushed open a little and if everyone tries to get these agreements cleaned up  and executed that PG&E and Enron ( Canada & US ) can start to transact.

With that being said, there are two areas which I would like to refresh from our discussions..

1.  Did you give any further thought to the utilization of Daily gas sales as a collateral.. I truly believe that this vehicle is a very efficient,easy way for PG&E to enhance the credit with ENA and once we have a 30 day bucket... we can get you trading access to EOL.  Lot's of details to work out, but I would like to keep this discussion at the forefront. I can send the details of how this proposal would work if required. ( let me know ) 

2.  As discussed, ENA holds some 5 year El Paso capacity. I am looking to assign this capacity and possibly and would like to investigate your supply requirements and possible alternatives such that you can consider our capacity.  

I trust all is well and look forward to talking to you soon.

He was considering another offer ( a different co.) and wanted to make a decision this week. As such I committed to informing him as to whether or not an offer will be made to him.

At this time, I am not going to make an offer and will advise him as such upon my next contact. Although he has some good qualities I am going to continue in my search.

Kids are doing well... my boys turned 1 in September and running rampant
around our house... the rest of the family including myself are scared of
them.  Olivia turned 4 recently and has quite a British accent now... I
sometimes wonder where she came from.
Josee has her hands full at home right now and after a weekend I am more
than ready to return to the office for rest.  
Markets have been choppy... my trading strategy over the past 2 months has
been very simple however.. as Randolph Duke said in the OJ futures pit on
Trading Places... SELL MORTIMER SELL.


Will send you a picture soon.. 
say hi to the wife for us.

Feudalism
You have two cows.
Your lord takes some of the milk.

----------

Fascism
You have two cows.
The government takes both, hires you to take care of them and sells you
the
milk.

----------

Pure Communism
You have two cows.
Your neighbours help take care of them and you all share the milk.

----------

Applied Communism
You have two cows.
You must take care of them, but the government takes all the milk.

----------

Totalitarianism
You have two cows.
The government takes them both and denies they ever existed. Milk is
banned.

----------

Pure Democracy
You have two cows.
You and your neighbours decide who gets the milk.

----------

Representative Democracy
You have two cows.
Your neighbours pick someone to tell you who gets the milk.

Mexican Democracy
You have two cows.
The government takes both and drafts you into the army.


----------

European Democracy
You have two cows.
The EU commission decides which regulations for feeding and milking
apply.
If
there aren't any, they invent some. They pay you not to milk the cows.
They take both cows, shoot one, milk the other and pour the milk down
the
drain.
They then require you to fill out forms accounting for the missing cows.


----------

American Democracy
The government promises to give you two cows, if you vote for it.
After the election, the president is impeached for speculating in cow
futures.
The press dubs the affair ""cowgate,"" but supports the president.
The cows sue you for breach of contract.
Your legal bills exceed your annual income.
You settle out of court and declare bankruptcy.


----------


Capitalism
You have two cows.
You sell one and buy a bull.
Your herd multiplies, and the economy grows. You sell them and retire on
the
income.


----------

Enron Venture Capitalism
You have two cows.
You sell three of them to your publicly listed company, using letters of
credit
opened by your brother-in-law at the bank, then execute a debt/equity
swap
with
an associated general offer so that you get all four cows back, with a
tax
exemption for five cows.  The milk rights of the six cows are
transferred
via an
intermediary to a Cayman Island company secretly owned by the majority
shareholder who sells the rights to all seven cows back to your listed
company.
The annual report says the company owns eight cows, with an option on
one
more.

The landscape of the shippers list is ever changing... Rumors of PPL pulling out 85,000/day to Malin and Stanfield is unconfirmed ( we are trying to validate)... and potentially Avista pulling out as they have been downgraded... they hold 35,000/day in 2003. Combined this is almost half of the planned expansion. 

Although not confirmed the bottom line is as the 03 shippers back out the expansion it becomes compromised and ultimately I believe the 2002 expansion and 2003 expansion start to blend together. As you guys know the 2002 shippers lists of 211,000 / day is made up 2 shippers Calpine 35,000/day and Newport Gen 175,000/day and this expansion has it's own issues.

Chad,  hope trading is going well.  Weather has been cool so I expect Sumas
basis has been tightening appropriately.   Per our conversation last week,
attached is my resume for your consideration.  Please pass on to the
appropriate people.   I am motivated in finding a position with a
progressive marketing company who could use my experience and knowledge of
the NW gas and electric market and where I can be part of a team that has
much larger view on the markets..   I definitely know that Enron fits that
model...

I condensed the two charts into one on the ""Santa Clara Load/Supply Profile"" page.  Is it too busy?

Also, I have included two pages (10&11) on the forward value of the EPNG capacity.  Which do you like better?  Regardless of which one we use, we do need to talk about the appropriate SJ/Perm split and physical premiums (if any).

I'll call in the morning.

Barry,

As promised, here are some of the current redeployment candidates that have a marketing/structuring/trading background for consideration concerning your West Origination opening.  I believe that you have seen Jim Lowe before and expressed some limited interest in him.  The other candidates are most likely new to you.

Let me know if you would like to pursue any of these redeployed employees.


     

Also, I spoke with Mark McConnell today, and he mentioned that he had accepted the offer to join the Transwestern group of ETS.  He primary motivation for selection of this option was his desire to work with asset deals.  As we know, given EWS ""asset light"" approach to deal making, this option would be difficult to fulfill within the West Origination group.  However, he mentioned that he was very impressed with your group, and short of the asset piece maintained a high interest in your open position.

Regards,
Todd Peikert"

Generally speaking, they HATE the El Paso pipe because of it's flow risk and are not interested in discussing this with me until such time that EL Paso deliverability becomes more reliable. 

Having them take this pipe as a vehicle to help offset our bankruptcy claim works from an economics point of view ( assuming you can agree on values), but I think you will have a battle regaring the quality of service that they are going to get. Regardless, it is a an out of the money position for us and we could accomodate if they wish to discuss further. Have Lisa or Michael call me if they wish to discuss logistics around this asset.

Steffes and I were just chatting and an idea came up, that we try to offer our El Paso capacity to PG&E in their bankruptcy suit (in which a settlement is being negotiated) and perhaps we can, in turn, reduce our claim against PG&E in that case.  Maybe this is already being done, but if not, it is a thought.  Lisa Mellencamp and Michael Tribolet are doing the bankruptcy case. "

He thinks pricing will be near a Ventura Monthly Index + $ .04. ( that's with no orig to Canada).  That is also with no ancillary deals behind this structure and that is what Lucci is trying to pull together. Paul, can you please investigate nom procedures, potential dry run structure ( Oct. 01) and verify what the structure looks like as the upstream diversions take place.( incl. default positions ).    

At a minimum let's buy the gas and sell it base load to storey.... then ENA - Denver will try to back fill some gas into the deal on a Interruptible basis.

I was unable to leave a message on your home machine or cell.  Really nothing too pressing but Schonne is wanting to follow up with us on our plans.. I did talk to him and told him not to assume that our PGT capacity will go to NEWCO, because NEWCO does not really exist and may never... SO, I told him to review  the tariff and make a determination as to whether or not it is still ours to use, if it isn't, then we don't really need to talk.. it they determine it is still ours, then we need to think about what the estate should do with it, including the upstream parts.

Peter is going to review the assignment doc's and with Steve raise the proper 
legal document that protects ECC/ENA's interests.  At this time, Peter and I 
are of the opinion that a new agreement may be all we need but we will 
discuss on Monday.

Julie/ Stephanie/Eric....we need to discuss the numbers again. The real 
producer unwind costs may be really ugly, which basically means that our 
numbers may be too low to Calpine.. even with the counter offer, the front 
end economics are pulling a lot of value out of the deal. 


Assuming numbers can be agreed too by everyone, we are positioning ourselves 
for a package out to the producers for early next week. 

Stephanie.. one of our customers has asked for California fundamentals... 
overview... do we have anything available.  

Talk to everyone on Monday.

As you guys know our group in total is going to be made up of a few key areas.

Producer Services 
Transportation
Origination/ Middle Marketing
Trading


Can you put together in draft form a business plan for next year that 
outlines some key items. Once we have a first pass at this, we can 
incorporate into the overall package and decide how this fits in with our new 
group. 
 
The key subject items should include:  

SM/MW/BT 1> Market Overview - supply demand fundamentals in your area. 
SM/MW/BT 2> Strategies and opportunities for 2001 ( What new initiatives will 
we implement ?)
SM/MW/BT 3> New products and structures for your area
SM/MW/BT 4> Issues in 2000 ( what didn't work ?)
BT  5> Organization Issues / people /transition etc. 


If you could start thinking about these in greater detail, we can then go 
through and incorporate into the west orig. objectives. 

Call me to discuss, but we should start to discuss detail early next week.

Subject: Enron - PGT Payout Table

Brad, further to our conversation of yesterday morning, please find attached 
Enron's payout table and alternative payout table regarding the permanent 
assignment of PGT capacity. 

The onus will be on Enron to deliver long dated capacity to Calpine and we 
will begin working on this immediately.

Below is a summary of some of the key next steps. Please review and we can 
discuss on Monday the numbers and final steps as required. 

ENA and Calpine will formalise  % discount, volume grid, lump sum $ amount or 
annuity amount. 
As discussed our cost of funds implied will be LIBOR + 200 basis points. ( to 
be confirmed ).
ENA will raise a precedent agreement with option language in favor of Calpine 
which allows you to request that the period 2 volume  be no less than the 
period 1 volume and up to the total delivered volume of 67,500 based on the 
agreed to % discount as referenced in point #1. 
ENA will forward the draft precedent agreement which will include the 
necessary conditions precedent required and with the general commercial terms 
as agreed per items above (ETA - Tues/Wed). 
ENA will provide a bid to Calpine on Monday afternoon with a number on the 
Spark Spread proposal.
Contact name @ Trans Canada and ANG is Kay Coad Ph: 403-267-2480.  
  
I trust the information as provided above is consistent with our previous 
discussions.  Please contact me once you have had a chance to review. 

Regards,

BT

As you guys know our group in total is going to be made up of a few key areas.

Producer Services 
Transportation
Origination/ Middle Marketing
Trading


Can you put together in draft form a business plan for next year that 
outlines some key items. Once we have a first pass at this, we can 
incorporate into the overall package and decide how this fits in with our new 
group. 
 
The key subject items should include:  

SM/MW/BT 1> Market Overview - supply demand fundamentals in your area. 
SM/MW/BT 2> Strategies and opportunities for 2001 ( What new initiatives will 
we implement ?)
SM/MW/BT 3> New products and structures for your area
SM/MW/BT 4> Issues in 2000 ( what didn't work ?)
BT  5> Organization Issues / people /transition etc. 


If you could start thinking about these in greater detail, we can then go 
through and incorporate into the west orig. objectives. 

Call me to discuss, but we should start to discuss detail early next week.

are of the opinion that a new agreement may be all we need but we will 
discuss on Monday.

producer unwind costs may be really ugly, which basically means that our 
numbers may be too low to Calpine.. even with the counter offer, the front 
end economics are pulling a lot of value out of the deal. 


Assuming numbers can be agreed too by everyone, we are positioning ourselves 
for a package out to the producers for early next week.

overview... do we have anything available.

WILLIAMS PUTS MEAT ON THE BONES OF WESTERN FRONTIER PROJECT DESIGN

Touting a need for more pipeline capacity linking the ""prolific"" supply basins of the central Rockies and increasingly hungry Mid-Continent markets, The Williams Cos. Inc. last week took the next step by filing for authorization to build and operate the Western Frontier project.

The sponsor has in hand four negotiated-rate deals for long-term service covering roughly two-thirds of the 540,000 Dt/day of project design capacity, it told FERC in an Oct. 24 certificate application (CP02-11). Williams wants to have the $366 million project up and running by Nov. 1, 2003; it asked the commission to issue a final certificate by Dec. 11, 2002, so that it can commence construction by the following April.

Williams unveiled initial plans for Western Frontier early last summer (IF, 9 July, 14) and held an open season in June and July. To carry gas from the Power River, Big Horn, Wind River and Green River basins- estimated to hold 173 Tcf of potential and recoverable reserves - the new 30-inch-diameter mainline would run 398 miles, starting at the Cheyenne Hub and ending at an interconnection with the system of affiliate Williams Gas Pipelines Central Inc. in Beaver County, Okla. Characterizing the Cheyenne Hub as ""a liquid point of supply,"" Williams asserted that ""presently, supply capability to the hub has outpaced transportation capacity away from the hub to market areas due to insufficient pipeline infrastructure.""

Along the way, the Western Frontier mainline would make another interconnection with Williams Central as well as with Northern Natural Gas Co., ANR Pipeline Co., Natural Gas Pipeline Co. of America and Panhandle Eastern Pipeline Co., ""thus providing multiple avenues for gas produced in the central Rockies to be transported throughout the Mid-Continent using the existing pipeline grid.""

To ""further enhance its supply options,"" the sponsor wants to build a 9.7-mile lateral from the mainline to the Wattenberg gas processing plant east of Denver to tap the Denver-Julesberg basin. Rounding out the project design are two new compressor stations, the 10,000-horsepower Chalk Bluff station to be constructed at the Cheyenne Hub and the 20,000-hp Denver station to be built in Adams County, Colo. Following the open season, Williams hammered out precedent agreements with Marathon Oil Co. (75,000 Dt/day), Williams Energy Marketing and Trading Co. (200,000 Dt/day), Utilicorp United Inc. (15,000 Dt/day) and Entergy Power Generation Corp. (75,000 Dt/day). The initial term for the deals is 10 years, except for Marathon which committed to a five-year term with an option to extend it an additional two years, said the application.

""Other shippers have expressed serious interest for the remaining capacity on Western Frontier, and active negotiations are moving forward with these potential shippers,"" said the application, adding that Williams was ""confident . . . that the remaining capacity will be committed in the upcoming months."" With the addition of compression, the project could ""facilitate relatively inexpensive expansions to accommodate future market growth,"" the sponsor told FERC. And that may well be necessary, it continued, pointing to ""stagnant to declining supply"" in the Mid-Continent basins coupled with ""projected demand increases."" As in many areas of the country, ""much of the anticipated demand increase is attributed to installation and operation of . . . gas-fired electrical generation,"" it said. The 11,439 Mw of ""active winter generating capacity"" in the combined service areas of Western Frontier and Williams Central is expected to more than double by 2004, said Williams.

The application seeks negotiated rate authority for the project operator, Western Frontier Pipeline Co. LLC, and approval of initial recourse rates. The maximum daily reservation rate under schedule FTS would be 35?/Dt for contract demand in Zone 1 and 79.4?/Dt in Zone 2. Under the negotiated deals reached with the four ""anchor"" shippers, Utilicorp and Entergy would pay a combined reservation and commodity rate of 25?/Dt at a 100% load factor for Zone 1 service to the Williams Central Hugoton station in Kansas, while WEM&T would pay a combined rate of 30?/Dt for Zone 2 transportation to the Williams Central system in Oklahoma and Marathon would pay 32?/Dt under the shorter contract for Zone 2 service to interconnects with ANR, Panhandle and Williams Central in
Oklahoma. All transportation would originate at the Cheyenne Hub."

I have talked to Crestone about backing us in a Northern Border transportation deal.  Basically they are on board, however I have not shown them any economics.  What I believe needs to take place is to identify Northern Border shippers who would be willing to release their capacity.  Once we are able to put the capacity release economics together, which will be driven by the Northern Border shippers, we will be able to 
show Crestone a deal.  I do not have any potential parties willing to release Northern Border capacity.  I have talked to the Central desk about this opportunity, they informed me that they had no interest in this type of an arrangement.  I personally believe we can manage ENA's current Northern Border position more efficiently but have been unable to convince others of this.  Any ideas you can provide would be helpful.

Jeff, thanks again for attending the discussions with DWR.

Do you have any recon.... on exactly which plants DWR has the right to bring the fuel on. As Mark indicated, it was about 1/3 of their exposure, and most of that was in the south service area, but I am very interested in the actual facilities and whom used to bring fuel to them or run the units.'

There is a zero sum game on fuel... but the landscape changes depending on who buys it and how they buy it! 

Any thoughts.

No hand-outs were provided.

Calculation of Receipt Point Capacity
Topock  540 mmcf/d
Ehrenberg 1250 mmcf/d
Needles 800 mmcf/d
Wheeler 800 mmcf/d

New Receipt Points
Kramer Junction 200 mmcf/d
Hector Rd 50 mmcf/d
Both will be available around Feb 1

Basis of Pro-Ration-Current Windows Calculation
Currently, Gas Control provides total receipt point capacity comprised of demand forecast and injection capability and compares to maximum amount of gas that can enter system.  Gas Select prorates interstate's receipt capacity based on prior day's nominations.

New Calculation, Changes and Display
Based on operational maximum with adjustments for maintenance.  SoCal ist aking and applying the current formula for Wheeler Ridge to all the points.  Any changes to operational maximum will probably be due to maintenance and posted on Gas Select.  Customer will choose which points it wants to reduce receipts.  Operating maximums will equal demand forecast plus injections.  Demand forecast will rely on Gas Control weather forecast.  They use Weather Bank as one of their tools.

OFO Declaration
Name changes from overnomination
Can declare before any Cycle
Provide 2 hour notice
Post on Gas Select
Show OFO Calculation on Gas Select

Windows
Reason to set windows was to set limits to prevent too much gas from coming into system
Calculation based on noms which does not work well.  Lots of complaints.   People were complaining that it restricted access to the system.  Eliminating point specific calculation.  Open system to Max Oper. Limits or Contractual Limits.   Will continue to operate Wheeler Ridge under Aug 1 procedures.  No changes to Wheeler Ridge.   
Due to the need to maintain operational control, an OFO will be declared when scheduled volumes are greater than the max operating capacity on any cycle.  
Replace windows with operational maximum volumes.  If  CPUC approves comprehensive settlement, will post 5 days of information to anticipate OFO's
Now customers will elect which point they will back off instead of using windows.

Scheduling Changes-Nov 1
Gas Select is being rebuilt and will be an internet system in mid-2002 .  No direct dial-up.     
Rollover noms-noms will be copied from cycle to cycle
Copy confirmed noms
All noms will be rolled over-will not be at discretion of 3rd party.  However, can still make  changes.  Can still upload new files.

2 Hour Notice
Socal will provide 2 hour notice on  Gas Select of OFO.  Other methods include leaving message on Socal Hotline (213-244-3900) and list of e-mail messages that can go directly to pagers.  Gas Select is official notification.  Courtesy notification is hot line and e mail.  Gas Select is a subscriber- based system mandated by CPUC and must get regulatory change to make free.
OFO's are going to be system wide and not customer specific.  OFO's can be declared intraday.  Once OFO declared, it will be kept for entire day.  Concerned that if call off, will have to put back on.  Don't want to go back and forth.  This decision may be reconsidered once they see how it works.  Many times Socal see an increase of 200 mmcf/day between Cycle 3 and 4 so they are concerned.  

Scheduled vs. Capacity-Declare OFO
Nominations may not exceed 110% of expected usage.  
Expected Usage is defined as usage for the same day for the prior week.  Can revise expected usage.
No interruptible storage injections allowed during OFO.
Use Elapsed Pro-Rata Rules
Expected Usage-cut nominations to 110% of expected usage so will use same day  of the prior week as proxy.  Generators need to revise expected usage.  Acceptance of changes are at the discretion of SoCal.
Flow Day Diversions don't go into effect until after Cycle 4.  Gas Control will determine if flow day diversion will be allowed.  
If call OFO after cycle 3 or 4 and have interruptible storage injections, such storage will be prorationed back under the elapsed prorata rules.
Many people were concerned that interruptible storage will be severely compromised.  
If OFO called , Interruptible Storage could be cut under the elapsed prorata rules as follows:

Cycle 1    Nom 1000  ; 0 cut
Cycle 2 Nom 1000; 666 cut
Cylce 3 Nom 1000; 500 cut
Windows will only be implemented during cycle 4 if OFO callled after cycle 3 and no improvement is realized.  Will allocate prorata.  Will use latest scheduled volume and will pro rate by receipt point.  In other words, if OFO declared during Cycle 1 and no relief after 3 cycles, Socal will window Cycle 4 and prorata cut. Parties will determine what gets cut on all the other cycles. For penalty purposes, actual burn from 12 o'clock to 12 o'clock will be used to calculate penalties or MAXDQ if not metered.  
For OFO, assume supply delivereis day before and burn is the same day for the prior week.  Declare OFO on prior day's scheduled volume.

For an evening declaration-will use most recent available scheduled volumes.  For example:

         Flow Day 10/4                10/3 Scheduled Volumes
Cycle 1                                    Cycle 2
Cycle 2                                     Intraday 1
Cycle 3				evening cyle 2 on 10/4
Cycle 4                                     Intraday 1 on 10/4

In other words, will look at evening cycle 2 scheduled volumes on the 3rd for declaring OFO on cycle 1 for the 4th.; look at intra day 1 for the 3rd in declaring OFO for cycle 2 on the 4th;  look at evening cycle 2 on 10/4 in declaraing OFO for Cycle 3 on the 4th;  look at intraday 1 on the 4th in declaraing OFO on cycle 4 for the 4th.

Winter Balancing Rules
Effective Nov 1-March 31
No changes.
All customers must comply.
Minimum delivery requirements
50% of daily usage over 5 day period; (Nov 1-5;6-10;)
70% of daily usage depending on storage level
70% daily usage implemented when storage levels equal 20 bcf above peak day min
90% of daily usage depending on storage level
90% rule implemented when storage levels equal 5 bcf  plus peak day min.
Look at storage graph on Gas Select.  Posted 24 hours in advance if the minimum daily is changed.  If go to 70% , current 5 day cycle must end completely, before new % goes into effect.
Must increase storage inventory by 1 bcf above the 70% before going back to 50% rule.
Once 90% rule implemented, will return to 70% as soon as operationally feasible,

Contracted Marketer's customer usage and delivereies are aggregated in one balancing account.

Core Aggregation-subject to 50% daily throughout entire winter period based on DCQ.  
Core-50% of daily throughput for the enitre period,; (Patrick Brown group)
Not subject to 70% and 90% rules.

2 types of gas count toward daily obligation- firm storage withdrawal and flowing gas.  As-available storage and imbalance trading do not count.

Burn=measured daily usage thru electronic measurement,
Min DQ-used if customer does not have electronic measurement.

Customer assessed  GIMB charge if total deliveries is less than 50% of total burn over 5 day period.  Customer purchases gas at daily balancing stand-by rate under  G IMB Rate Schedule which is 150% of highest Socal Border price per NGI Gas Daily plus franchise fees and other charges.  Rate is posted at end of every month.

Hi,

	My name is Iris Mack.  Currently I work on Enron's Power Options Trading desk.  

	I am primarily responsible for building our business in long-term, derivatives structures/trades on multiple commodities and financials.  For example, we are exploring potential structures and trades which involve power, gas, crude oil, weather derivatives, metals, etc.  Some of the building blocks for these multi-commodity derivatives products may be found in the attached document.

 	We are looking to build this business via utilizing as many of Enron's internal resources as possible.  Hence, it would be most helpful to meet with the relevant individuals in Gas Trading who would be interested in the development of multi-commodity derivatives trades/structures which may used to develop customized risk management tools for our clients.
	
	Thank you in advance for your assistance.
    
Kind regards,
Iris Mack, MBA/PhD

I would rather not get into the habit of locking in curves before the deal is officially closed (signed).  Can we just agree on a sharing policy, so that we may avoid the event underlined below.  I would like to consider the curves floating until it is booked.  We are all sharing the risk of Huber not signing.

Thanks,
Mike

Further to our conversation please find attached the curves on the JM Huber transaction that we have agreed to work off of. The 30,000/day of capacity will sit on the books until next week but the deal with HUBER is effectively completed. In the event that this deal does not close, then the West desk will resume with the same MTM risks that you presently have.  

Any curve shift positive from now until the transaction is actually unwound will be credited back to the orig desk and any negative curve shift from here on in will be credited to the trading desk... plus ENA Orig and trading will work on a sharing calculation payable for any future deals. 

In addition to the transportation income being generated, additional orig will be generated by entering into wellhead and market based transactions with the desks. I believe that all of the risks and discussions associated with the structures have been well communicated with each book ( by Mark Whitt ) and we will be meeting with each of you early next week to get the structures and booking set up properly.

I trust that this note covers the general areas related to this deal and I am very pleased with the high level of cooperation shown by everyone..

Pls review file and if there are any questions give me a call.

BT

     Actually, the money that is in Clarica is part pension and part rrsp, 
     however the pension money, (that should cause it to be locked in) is 
     actually not locked in. I guess that it was not vested. As a result of 
     this, I am looking to transfer it all the one rrsp.
     Let me know if you or Jacy have questions.

     Barry: I will send a note to Jacy. Also the funds I think we will
go 
     into are going to be more heavily weighted towards stocks, but will
     
     have some bonds as well, that what makes them a balanced fund.

I wasn't worried for a second.
     
I would like to have these funds in a portfolio that has a better 
performance than money markets. I already have a decent amount of money 
( 60K) in the Rice portfolio thru andrew agencies in Virden. You may 
want to look at exactly what that is, contact Jacy Whyte at Andrew 
Agencies... he will get you the details for Kim and I. 
     
Was there a particular index fund you had in mind? What do you mean by 
balanced ? Once we put it there I don't plan on touching or managing 
this until I return to Canada.  
     
Thanks, talk to you soon.

     You probably thought I had forgotten about you! I had not. I wanted
to 
     iron out some areas of concern from my end here. As you know, I am
not 
     supposed to do an investment for you while you are a resident of
the 
     US. I have discovered that if we put the money into an account and
not 
     make moves on it until you move back to Canada, then we can do it
if I 
     use a Canadian address. I was advised to put the money into a
balanced 
     fund and leave it there for now. My thoughts are to move it to a 
     couple of funds in a self administered account and NOT make any
moves 
     with it. 
     
     Please review this note, and let me know what you think. If all is
ok 
     I will mail you the forms to sign (which you signed here), and we
will 
     get this moving.
     
     Hope all is well with you down there.

Generally, the US form is the same as the form which PG&E provided to ECC back in 2000 (with the exception that the US form has been amended to contemplate confirmations through EnronOnline and the insertion of the price indices to use to calculate liquidated damages).  As a result, some of our comments (i.e. the idea that a transaction is entered at the time of the telephone conversation/online transaction and is not dependent upon a confirmation being issued) would apply equally to both the US form and the Canadian form.

 However, there are a number of changes which would have no bearing on the US form.  They are:

1.	insertion of representations and warranties relating to:
a.  eligible financial contracts under Canadian insolvency law;
b.  certain Canadian securities representations;

2.	amendments to Article 4 - Delivery Point - whereby the delivery point is to be in Canada (However, the US Form does contain the clause relating to extraction rights at Cochrane Extraction Point (in s.4.1) which we are seeking to fix.);

3.	amendments to the liquidated damages mechanics in the Canadian form which utilize AECO/NIT as a basis.  The amended US Form includes a number of alternative indices (however, the amended US form does not contemplate changes to or lack of availability of the chosen indices); and

4.	in Article 11, amendments to the Canadian form re: Delivery Point force majeure may not be applicable to the US form.

In addition to the Canadian jurisdiction matters, there are certain amendments which we are seeking for Enron Canada which are not applicable to the US form.  These requests were needed for the Canadian form because PG&E's counsel made a number of unsolicited changes to the Canadian form in his draft in May, 2001 which are not found in the US form.  For example:

1.	amendments to section 2.2 on tape retention is not necessary in the US form as there is merely an obligation to protect the tapes from improper access (as oppose to an obligation to protect the tapes from loss or tampering);

2.	      our amendments to the payment netting provisions of section 7.7 are not necessary for the US form as the US form does not restrict netting of payments solely to monthly payments for Gas deliveries;

3.	      our proposed amendments to the collateralization provisions of section 8.2 are not as key as the US form does not have a clause which (i) would effectively bar Enron from calling for collateral or (ii) include an acknowledgement that any security may require the approval of the Bankruptcy Court; and

4.	      our proposed changes to section 8.3 are not applicable as the US form does not provide PG&E with the excuse of ""lack of Bankruptcy Court consent"" with respect to the provision of collateral.

Hopefully, this gives you an idea of where we are at with the two documents.  If you have further questions prior to our meeting tomorrow, please give me a call at 820-6708.

Thanks,

Mark

Mark can do, but as general proposition I think tht you can assume that none of the changes to the Canadian form have been made to the US form, some of which will be jurisdictional to Canada and others of which will not.  Mark please prepare a brief summary.

If one of the exercises is to standardize ( as best as possible the two agreements) I think we need to create a document that identifies the variance in the agreements. Has this been done and if so, can I have a copy to review. I have gone through both the US and Canadian agreements but am not sure where some of the subtle differences lie.

My name is Tamara and I work with Judy on the Enron program here at
PricewaterhouseCoopers.  I have been looking over your file and have a
question with regard to the fax which you sent to us on August 29, 2001.
There may have been a misunderstanding regarding the intention of you
faxing those documents to us.  We looked at the fax and understood it to be
for our files.  However, from your most recent email, we are now thinking
that you had expected us to take some kind of action on your behalf with
the IRS.

The original notice from the IRS is dated June 23rd, 2001.  It states that
should you not agree with their figures, you should contact them.  We
assumed that you did not agree with the notice and had contacted them.  Our
question is: did you contact the IRS and/or send in the forms with your
wife's SSN or was it action that we were meant to take?  If you could
please clarify this at your earliest convenience, we will try to get this
resolved as soon as possible.

after 10 years of ENRON being the model for other companies on how to 
succeed in the energy industry. What's your take on why it happened?  We get 
a little bit of news down here but we're a little out of touch.

How are you taking it?  Are you pissed? Do you feel like you squeezed pretty 
much what you wanted out of the job? What's the next thing for Barry Tic?  
Well, like all of life's curve-balls there is always something sweet in the 
next pitch you get (jeez, how sappy is that!).  Anyway, hope you're taking 
it all with the good nature you always do.

Hey, maybe this will give you the chance to take a holiday in Ecuador 
(Christmas turkey at our house this year?).  Say hi to Kim for us, drop me a 
line as soon as you can (a better address to reach me is craigh@ph.com.ec).  
Sorry I haven't sent a note before this but you know we are always rooting 
for you.

Subject:	Terminations Process

Following is a suggested order of events:

1) Contact customer to float concept. If they are interested in a termination, present an initial suggested number. If they are interested in an assignment to a third party, ask for their permission to discuss their deals with other companies, such as Duke and Williams. It is preferred to do a simple termination to the assignment

2) Ask Melissa Murphy (31886) for a list of transactions, the MTM values and copies of the confirms associated with them. Ensure the values represent today's MTM

3) Show the transaction list and valuations to the gas and power traders responsible for those delivery points. Ask them to initial the MTM values and the volumes. Ensure they understand that terminating the deals will make them longer/shorter at each location and obtain their approval to proceed with doing so.

4) Contact customer with the fresh MTM number and obtain final verbal agreement.

5) Work with Jim Meyn/Leonardo Pacheco to put together final contract, complete with copies of the terminated confirms.

6) Bring the final contract to Dave Forster for final signature/approval.

7) Ensure full contract execution ASAP. Chase counterparty as necessary.

The 1995 Policy Statement said that, when the roll-in increased rates to existing shippers by less than 5%, the pipeline needed to make only a general showing of system benefits, and FERC said that Transco had satisfied that showing.  

The 1999 Policy Statement, however, has a threshold requirement for expansion projects requiring that there can be no subsidization from existing customers - in other words, no increase in costs of any kind.  The PGT order found that there was a possibility that fuel costs could increase for existing shippers; therefore, PGT had to establish a surcharge mechanism to subject expansion shippers to an incremental fuel charge for fuel costs above those that would apply absent the new compression.  If the fuel costs do not increase, then there will be no surcharge.

Subject:	PGT Fuel Treatment

Greetings Becky:

Met with PGT the other day. Based upon a recent FERC ruling on the treatment of fuel on a project on Transco's Leidy Lateral (last 2 weeks), PGT is going to ask FERC to reverse its ruling on the 2002 expansion. If you remember, FERC was very clear on the notion that existing shippers should not subsidize increased costs associated with incremental shippers. I've been told that Transco received approval for rolled in treatment of higher fuel because they did not have an ""incremental"" tariff.  

This sounds very suspicious - can you please investigate?

Thanks,

Stephanie "

The PD by Cmmr. Bilas allowed it to go forward, subject to conditions.  The

Re the cottage in Riding Mountain - go ahead.  Two things:  it isn't
useable in the winter, so it's not available for your use and the second
thing is that you are going to be purchasing it AFTER you've become a

Same settlement to unbundle socal that's been before the commission for about a year.  On the commission's agenda to consider, but as has been the case for over year, they've delayed any movement--at least one commissioner doesn't like competition and has the discretion to continue to ask that it be delayed.  Some hold the view that there's a push to try to get it moved, but best guess is 50-50 at this point.

Subject:	ENE comps

Grant, ENE trades at 7x 2001 expected recurring earnings and 0.9 times book value.  This is far lower than a quick industry average of 15.5 times 2001 expected earnings and 2.8 times current book value (industry includes Duke, EL Paso, Williams, Dynegy, Kinder Morgan, and Aquila).  I think what these ratios demonstrate is the risk of the unknown that is being priced into ENE.  For example the current price to book seems like a suspect ratio to use for ENE given that it is unclear what is on our books and what else needs to be written down.  If you look at ENE on a price to earnings after non-recurring items for 2001 it looks far less attractive at 22.9 times.  If you take ENE's earnings after ""non-recurring"" items and slap on the industry average multiple of 15.5 times ENE's share price is $8.51 (ouch).  Now obviously not everything in the non-recurring events are actually recurring but there is talk of some wholesale losses being buried in the ""non-recurring"" loss.

ENE's long-term debt to equity is 0.9 times but if you include all the off balance sheet leverage and the leverage inherent in our trading business the true number is significantly higher than 0.9 times.  On a positive note the ENE's debt is trading higher today (price not yield).

Here is a spreadsheet from Bloomberg with the S&P pipelines sub sector P/Es, and P/Bs. and dividend per share (ENE's is 4%, nothing like a share price falling by 85% to get that div yield up).  I have also attached the latest Wall Street Journal article touting Berkshire, Royal Dutch, and GE as potential suitors (do you think Buffet can understand ENE?).

Hope this helps

State building natural gas reserve
Officials refuse to reveal details of the contracts
Bernadette Tansey, Lynda Gledhill, Chronicle Staff Writers
Thursday, August 16, 2001

URL: <http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/08/16/MN209239.DTL>


California has quietly started buying natural gas in response to the energy crisis, forming a gas supply operation that could become one of the largest in the state.

But in a repeat of the state's tactics when it lined up $43 billion in electricity contracts, officials won't say how much they have spent so far -- or how much they plan to buy in the future.

The state is already supplying gas for one power plant this month in an attempt to keep generating costs in check, and it has signed a small contract for gas storage space, state officials said. But they refused to provide The Chronicle with records of any of the purchases.

Releasing additional details -- such as the price officials paid -- would jeopardize the state's goal of keeping electricity costs down by delivering cheaper fuel to natural gas-fueled power plants that serve California, said Ray Hart, deputy director of the state Department of Water Resources.

If private energy traders knew what the state planned to buy, Hart said, they could rush in, scoop up the supplies and demand substantially higher prices to resell them to the state, he said.

Details of the state's gas deals will be made public as much as six months after they're signed, when they no longer give traders any advantage, he said.

That stance has raised an outcry among Republicans and consumer advocates, who criticized the Davis administration earlier this year for delaying disclosure of state power contracts that locked in a huge percentage of California's power needs for more than a decade.

""If there were a competitive bidding process, then, yes, the price should be secret while it's pending,"" said Marcel Hawiger, a natural gas analyst for the consumer group The Utility Reform Network. ""But in a situation like it is now where they're just negotiating backroom deals, we think they should be disclosing everything right away.""

Critics of the Davis administration who think the state already got rooked on the power contracts are equally leery about the state's foray into the natural gas market.

'A DISASTER'

""The governor's secrecy and lack of oversight has been a disaster for the people of California over the last six months,"" said Republican gubernatorial candidate and current Secretary of State Bill Jones. ""These are the same novices who signed those energy contracts.""

Hart said the gas operation would reinforce the state's long-term power buying effort that he credits with taming the out-of-control electricity market in California. His department was pressed into service as an emergency electricity buyer in January after skyrocketing power prices drove state utilities deeply into debt.

The state's new natural gas endeavor is intended as an insurance policy to make sure power plants under long-term contracts with the state don't hike their prices by claiming steep costs for fuel, a justification used by many generators during the height of the energy crisis last winter.

Under terms of some of the state electricity contracts, if the power plants don't make low-cost deals for gas, the state can step in and deliver the fuel itself.

The plan is to stand ready to provide fuel to generators throughout the state by lining up natural gas supplies, setting up to ship gas through pipelines within the state, and arranging for temporary storage space so any state gas surplus can be saved instead of being sold at a loss, Hart said. If the state were to step in as supplier for all the contracts that give it that option, the government would become one of the largest gas purchasers in the state, he said.

Hart's agency signed a four-year, $2 million contract in May with a Livermore gas consulting firm, Interstate Gas Services. The firm was authorized in July to make short-term gas deals with four suppliers in Texas and one in California.


STRATEGY QUESTIONED
Whether the state will be a successful player in the natural gas market is already being questioned by TURN and Pacific Gas and Electric Co. They say the state is reading the future gas market incorrectly by predicting prices close to double what experienced utility gas managers say the state will see by late 2002.

Bill Marcus, a TURN energy consultant, said the state's high forecasts alone could lead to unnecessary rate increases. Ron Low, a PG&E spokesman, said state gas cost overestimates would add $300 million to consumers' bills statewide through 2002; about $140 million would be paid by PG&E customers.

Hart scoffed at PG&E's claims.

""For them to say the price of gas is going to stay the same is ridiculous,"" Hart said. Gas prices have dropped this summer because of the cool weather and conservation efforts, he said. But things could change rapidly when demand peaks in the future. ""You're going to see prices go up again.""

Mark Allen Bernstein, an analyst with RAND, said the state might be doing the right thing if it buys natural gas when prices are low in the spring and fall and socks it away in storage basins to release when demand spikes in the summer and winter.

""We need to make sure there is sufficient storage to weather demand and price fluctuations,"" he said.

The state has lined up a small contract with the Wild Goose storage basin in Butte County and is supplying gas to an Alliance power plant as it starts operations this month, water department officials said. It has also locked in gas supplies at a set price for Dynegy plants in Southern California. The state has still not decided whether to contract for space on the interstate pipelines that bring gas to California from out-of-state producing basins, Hart said.

Hart said critics of the state's electricity contracts who said the deals all should have locked in a fixed price had already been proved wrong. By allowing some of the contract prices to float up or down with the price of gas,

Hart said, the state has been able to take advantage of a steep drop in gas prices this spring.

""We got totally hammered by the media for those (variable) contracts,"" Hart said. ""My God, we're saving billions of dollars.""

With out a doubt, we need to discuss this effort as it relates to and creates conflict or duplicate coverage.. I look forward to the discussion and did try to call you earlier today to discuss directly.

If you are unaware of this, I have put placed in charge of the fundamentals for the Northwest, Rockies, and Southwest on the desk.  Matt and Steve are currently working on the Northwest and Monique is working on the Southwest.

I am in desperate need of some help on the Rockies as this is the largest fundamental task we have to present in the West, including California in my opinion.  I want to make a full presentation to the group next Wednesday of the complete Rockies picture.  I have already done a lot of work on this, but I am in need of additional information and help.

Paul...we have already talked about load.  I need to know by Monday whether or not we can get numbers from PSCO.  If so, I need them on Monday.  If we can't, I understand the problems with that and I will go forward with what I have.

Tyrell...you seem to have the best handle on production numbers in the Rockies.  Could you please update your production numbers out through the winter.  If you can get your hands on any historical production data showing trends that would be great.  I was thinking that maybe we could ask some of the producers we have done deals with to  give us their production history back to last September or October.  Also, if you have any good information on decline curves (especially the difference between CBM in Powder and the deeper wells in other areas) I would love to include that.

Theresa...can you talk to Trailblazer, CIG, WIC and get the latest on any significant capacity increases (including quantities and schedules) through the middle of next year.  The major thing is the Trailblazer expansion...are they on time...what is the timing...what is the exact volume coming online...etc.  Also, if they know of any major maintenance issues over the next several months I would like to know them.

I know I am asking for quite a bit in a short period of time, but you can also see that there is no way that I can do all this myself plus everything else I am trying to work on.  Please let me know if you have any questions or concerns.  I would like to have all this information to me by midday Tuesday at the latest.  Call me with any questions or comments.

Thank you,

Jay

Further to some recent conversations block off Sunday Sept 9 and all day Monday Sept 10 for a group offsite.

By invite, you will be asked to participate in some offsite activities and business meetings in Denver.  

All flight, hotel, travel, meals and entertainment will be coordinated by Barry Tycholiz.  Booking of flights, which will have you departing on Sunday a.m. and arriving  around 12:00 in Denver, have been coordinated by our group to keep control of the flight costs.  We should have you home early on Monday evening ( around 10:30 p.m.). 

We have been able to get some really low fares and I want to keep them that way.  All the Houston based staff plus Portland (Fuller) will come to Denver.

Please see Jessica regarding flight times and schedules. 

A more formal agenda and list of topics/presenters will be sent to each of you in the next couple of days.

If there are any questions, give me a call at 713-853-1587.

Judy, you were?assigned to my U.S and Canadian  tax returns. I am a
employee of Enron North America and previously was an  employee of Enron
Canada in Calgary.

As we had discussed at the time of my filing, I was  never given any
advise
on my relocation to the U.S. regarding tax issues, As  such I am not
sure
what some of my next moves should be.?I very much  require some
assistance?regarding spousal employment. My wife is a  registered nurse
and
would like to work in the U.S., but I have been advised  that this may
affect my filing in the U.S. and perhaps could cost me more in  U.S.
Taxes.

Can we set up a meeting to discuss strategies on  making sure I am going
about this properly.

In spite of the news in the media about Enron, I see
opportunity. Since we've communicated last I've been real
busy selling my services to major energy traders. Actually
Enron is one of the traders that have my company listed as
one of three or four minority businesses that will be
involved with supplying the power for contracts. These
contracts start at $100,000,000 and go up.

Barry, I'm going to forge ahead, but I'd still rather have
the opportunity to work and learn from the biggest and
best.
One of my strong points is to get the deal done, another is
to understand my limitations. If you give me the shot on
the origination side you'd be most pleased. If I can
convince the world's largest energy trader to put me on
their contracts and RFPs after being in business for less
than a year, just think what could be done with a
supportive back office and timely information.

What I'm seeking is a chance to excel with all the tools at
my disposal. Drop me a email and tell me your thoughts.

Thanks for taking time Friday to meet with us......Sorry I missed you but I agree the meeting did go well.....I think you were successful in helping Michael Lynch over his hurdle concerning transport and gas supply which you rightfully point out are two distinct and separate issues.

I appreciate Stephanie Millers role in assisting our group in identifying obstacles and solutions in our development effort.  I hope you are not thinking of redirecting her.  She works well with our group.

With regard to Longview, lets coordinate the Gas Services Agreements through our development group.  I would prefer not to send McCook any further documentation until they have responded to our PSA and Management Agreements.  McCook is good at making us work and never responding. They owe us some Good Faith if you know what I mean.

I would appreciate it if you would continue to respond to McCooks questions about transport and supply...It sould like they need to get into an open season at the right time and you have a much better feel for that timing that I do.

Regards,
Jake

Jake, sorry I missed you on Friday. I took off around 4:00 and assumed you were tied up with MCCook.  If you have time today, give me a call.

If there is any chance that these guys are going to buy the plant, then they really need to get into the open seasons with Williams and PGT.... timing is everything. 

I also would like to discuss Stephanie Millers future role in the development game and would like your direct feedback. 

Thanks for having us at the meeting, I thought it went OK, but there really were two seperate agenda's and they were as much concerned about the price of their gas as they were interested in how it is going to get to the plant... and as you know, one doesn't really have to do with the other.

it should be easy to remove if needed. We also changed from a two-month term

Subject:	EES Agreement

Earlier this week, EES (Dave Delainey and Janet Dietrich) agreed the following with ENA:

- EES will continue to approach utilities/munis to sell their ""whitepaper"" concept, but will restrict their efforts to only the following, until such time as the concept is proven or abandoned:

	- City of San Antonio
	- City of Austin
	- Brownsville Public Utility Board
	- City of Anaheim
	- Peoples
	- SMUD
	- Silicon Valley (Santa Clara)
	- City of Memphis

- EES agreed that they should not be approaching industrials which fall within the previously established ENA SIC codes and committed to reigning their people in. It was agreed that EES would work with ENA to determine if there are subgroups within the SIC codes which are too small for ENA, but which EES should be covering. Chris Calger agreed to work with EES on determining this. The SIC Code categories which ENA is responsible for are as follows (note that while the categories have been agreed, the actual code numbers are my own interpretation of the categories):

10 - Primary Metals Mining and Extraction 
13 - Oil and Gas Extraction
26 - Paper and Forest Products
5169, 2899, 5191, 5169 - Chemicals - except for pharmaceutical, biotech and small specialty chemical that will be EES customers  (DOW Chemical)
2911 - Refining
29 - Petroleum and Coal Manufacturing
30 - Plastics and Rubber Manufacturing
5191 - Fertilizer
3531 - Rail
2891, 3559, 5094, 1422, 3241, 3297, 5032 - Cement
3274, 1422, 5191, 2041, 2869 - Large Agricultural Processing

Importance:	High

Attached are three documents (cover memo, draft settlement proposal,
settlement procedures timeline) comprising SRP's formal proposal to resolve
five pending dockets, RP99-507 (Indicated Shippers' Complaint), RP00-336
(Order No. 637 Allocation and Pooling Issues only), RP99-139 (ONEOK
Complaint), RP01-484 (Indicated Shippers/California Complaint), and RP01-486
(Texas, New Mexico and Arizona Shippers' Complaint). We appreciate the
suggestions received to date and believe that while an uncontested
settlement may be unlikely, a sufficient nucleus is forming around the
elements of this proposal that will lead to the filing of an Offer of
Settlement and ultimate FERC approval as in the public interest.  We
encourage your active participation in this process.

Note that while Advisory Staff present at the July 18 Technical Conference
is aware conceptually that SRP will be distributing a settlement proposal,
this proposal has not been distributed to the Advisory Staff.  This proposal
has been sent to Rick Miles, Director, Dispute Resolution Services, for
informational purposes only at this time.

Our liability should be limited to recoveries from the insurances required in the contract and specifically purchased for work under this contract. If covered by the policy, we will respond.  Losses, costs and expenses not recovered from the insurance, shall remain the obligation of Citizens. 

Once again, if they agree to the limitation, the continued concerns would be:
1. The indemnity would be set aside by a court.
2. The indemnity from Citizens does not hold or they are financially unable to respond.

Please advise if there are further questions.

Subject:	LADWP Gas Contract


Dear Potential Gas Supplier

As some of you may know our authority to buy gas off our existing spot agreement
will come to an end on December 31, 2001.  While we will honor current
commitments for gas to be delivered after that date, but we will not be able to
use the spot agreement to buy any more gas.  The reason that this is happening
is that our City Attorney has interpreted the new City Charter as not allowing
delegations of authority such as employed in the way we buy gas now.

We are seeking approval for an ordinance which must be approved by the City
Council that will restore our former ability to buy gas with the kind of
agreement most gas suppliers are familiar.  We have the ordinance approved by
the City Attorney and it will shortly be in the pipeline for approval by our
Board and the City Council, but until then, this contract is a stop gap to keep
us operating.

I've attached the new contract and a cover letter which explains what we are
doing.  The deadline is November 8, 2001 at 4:00 PM.  We will take the executed
contracts to our Board with the counterparties listed on a Board Resolution and,
if it is approved, we will be allowed to buy gas from this group after the new
year begins.  This is not the ideal contract but one we feel our Board will be
comfortable with until we can get around the Charter problem.  I can't make any
changes to this contract.  There is a notice published in the LA Times about the
availability of the contract but I am sending it to you directly as someone we
have already done business with (and undoubtedly have satisfied all our
boilerplate requirements) and will probably be interested in what we are trying
to do here.

I Hope most of you will respond.  Thanks

Send me a note when you get back and we can set up a meeting then.

Also, I received a notice from the IRS and it appears that they were
missing information on my wife and as such disallowed me claiming her as
a dependent.  I will send to your attention to review and clarify. Based
on my filing and actual refund there is about a $ 1k difference which I

Good morning Barry,

Just to let you know that I am on holidays August 11-26, so your
counselling will have to be this week or when I return.

Did Enron provide you with approval for a ""Post Arrival
Consultation""/PAC?
This is the counselling our PwC Houston office does.  (So, in effect
there
are two possible counselling sessions for assignees - the predeparture
counselling you are supposed to receive before you depart Canada and
then
there's the PAC).  PwC Houston is prepared to set up the ""PAC"" - they
simply want to know if you received approval for it.

Thanks,

Subject:	Kern River 637 Segmentation Issue

Report from yesterday's technical conference.  FYI, Kern River originally argued that there is no viable segmentation opportunity on its system because there are currently no gas supply sources available to its shippers between the Utah and Nevada markets to source a segmented transport.  After a technical conference last October, Kern River did file a segmentation proposal, but I'm not sure how much value it would have as a practical matter.  Note the Southwest Gas arguments (summarized in #3 below) for allowing backhauls from California to Las Vegas under a segmented agreement.

Subject:	Kern River 637 Segmentation Issue

Becky,

I did attend this morning's Kern River technical conference in Docket No. RP00-337 at FERC.  The discussion was only on the segmentation proposal made by Kern River.  They have filed pro forma tariff sheets to allow:
segmenting of firm contracts at any point
segmentation and release
subject to a limitation of MD at any overlapping points
backhaul from supply pooling points or points where gas is physically received
sets out secondary priorities for transportation within the path and outside the path

After Kern River made this pro forma filing, there were two protests by Dynegy and Southwest Gas.  Kern River discussed these protests at this technical conference in attempt to resolve all issues.

1.  Kern River agreed with Dynegy's point that a segmenting shipper should retain primary rights to mainline capacity when using points within the original contract path or even when outside of path but the mainline constraint remains the same as within the path.

However, after determining priorities on mainline capacity, if constraints occur at specific new points in the segmented transaction, then the transaction could be given secondary priority based on the receipt or delivery point capacity.

Indicated Shippers needed to be assured that their capacity to Wheeler would not be diminished due to this new policy.  Kern River responded that this is how they have always treated flex points and that because Wheeler was a constrained point, any segmented transactions that used Wheeler (new) would be secondary to the current rights (not on the basis of mainline but on the basis of the delivery point scheduling).

2.  In response to Southwest's first issue, Kern River also agreed to make changes to provide parity between segmentation for release and segmentation for a shipper's own use of transportation.  If a shipper segments a contract, it can get additional primary receipt or delivery point capacity within the path if it is available from the pipeline.

It was also noted that a shipper can segment a contract that goes from A to C into two transactions - A to B and then a backhaul from C to B.  In doing this, since there is no overlapping of mainline capacity, both transactions can be at the original MDQ.  The result could be double the MDQ at the new delivery point B.  This seems very flexible of Kern River and perhaps more than many other pipelines currently are willing to offer.  

3.  The last issue raised by Southwest was the controversial one and was not resolved at today's technical conference.  Southwest wants to use its firm transportation contract on Kern River through segmenting to backhaul from Wheeler Ridge delivery point or from PG&E delivery point to Las Vegas.  Kern River currently will provide this kind of service only on a IT basis - a separate service to Southwest.  They claim that this cannot be provided on a firm basis.  Southwest states that this is displacement service and barring insufficient deliveries at Wheeler or PG&E (very unlikely, according to Southwest), could be provided under their firm contract.  They are willing to take the risk that the capacity would not be available if Kern does not have enough forward haul to Wheeler or PG&E.

Indicated Shippers claimed that this is similar to a service provided by Transwestern; however Transwestern offered this as a pipeline firm service.  Kern River claims that it does not and cannot offer this backhaul as a firm service.  Kern River also argued that per GISB once gas is scheduled on a firm contract to a secondary point that it is considered firm.  IT can be bumped intraday and this backhaul service may be bumped.

Mirant also supported Southwest on this issue because they know of some power plants in the Las Vegas area being built that could use this kind of service.

Kern River maintained that this service is not required by Order No. 637.

Kern River will file changes to the pro forma tariff by May 15.  Comments by the parties are due June 1 and Kern River can file in reply by June 11.  Comments should be emailed to the parties.

If you remember, we looked at this issue back in March and I sent you the e-mail message below.  Since then, FERC has issued orders in Docket No. RP00-241 on 3/28/2001 and 6/11/2001 which reaffirmed its rulings in the orders discussed below.  There is no discussion in any of the orders on the specific mechanics of the recall other than what I already noted, namely, if the capacity has been recalled by El Paso or a shipper to serve a PG&E market, and the original shipper wants it back, it can re-recall the recalled capacity on 24 hours notice as long as it is using all of its other Block II capacity.  If you need something more ""legal"", we'll see what we can do.  If we have to go to Bracewell for a law firm legal opinion, there would be a charge since they'd have to do the same research before they could sign off on one.

Subject:	Re: block II  

I would note also that the recent reallocation of Topock rights takes care of one of the issues -- namely that El Paso allowed Dynegy to take Block II capacity to SoCal Topock.  The 4/14/00 order should have taken care of it, except for El Paso's position that they had capacity at Topock in the aggregate so they weren't overselling it.  

Order Date	Block II Rulings	
6/14/2000 Denial of Rehearing by Operation of Law	Denies Indicated Shippers request for rehearing of 4/14/00 order.	
4/14/2000 Order on Rehearing (Enron)	Clarifies the January 19 order to provide that El Paso may remarket the PG&E turnback capacity, including Block II, for primary delivery to delivery points other than PG&E Topock if capacity is available at those other delivery points.	
1/19/2000 Order on Negotiated Rate Transactions  (Enron & Williams)	Block II capacity has primary delivery rights only at PG&E Topock and alternative rights at the other Topock delivery points. Rejects CPUC argument against the recall provisions, which are the same as ultimately accepted in the Dynegy deal (see 10/19/99, 7/29/99, 9/17/98 and 6/11/98 orders) and provide (1) that there is no right of recall if the Block II capacity is simply idle, (2) that the capacity may be recalled if it is being used to serve points other than those behind PG&E Topock, and (3) if so recalled, it may be recalled by the original shipper for its own use in the PG&E service territory upon 24 hours notice. Clarifies, as in Dynegy, that the shipper (Enron) must use all its other Block II capacity before recalling other Block II capacity, but is not required to use Block I or Block III capacity first.	
10/19/1999 Order on Rehearing and Clarification (Dynegy)	Denies rehearing of 7/29/99 order 	
7/29/1999 Order on Rehearing and Compliance Filing (Dynegy)	 Affirms that PG&E and the CPUC are entitled to have the Block II capacity recalled to northern California even if it is under contract [to Dynegy]. Reverses previous ruling -- does not require that all other capacity to California be utilized before Block II capacity can be recalled. Per Settlement, recalling shipper must pay max rate to recall if its contract is one month or less.  If for more than one month, the rate must equal or exceed the rate of the existing shipper. On 24 hours notice, the existing shipper (i.e., Dynegy) may recall for its own use to serve northern California markets, capacity that was recalled for use by other shippers, even if those shippers are willing to pay a higher rate. Clarifies that if the Block II capacity is idle but is not being used to serve areas outside of northern California, [Dynegy] may hold the capacity without any obligation to release it.	
9/17/1998 Letter Order on Compliance Filing	Requires the Dynegy/El Paso agreement to clearly state that Block II capacity was recallable even though Dynegy had a minimum take requirement. Requires El Paso to eliminate use of alternative delivery points as the defining point for the service that would be recalled -- issue is markets served, not delivery points. Requires elimination of a clause requiring recalling shipper to submit a sworn statement that no capacity was available on other pipelines.	
6/11/1998 	Shippers in northern California cannot recall Block II capacity simply because it is not actually being used by [Dynegy]. Block II is recallable if [Dynegy] is using it to serve end users not within PG&E's service territory. Shippers who want to recall Block II capacity must have an actual need and may only recall if firm capacity is not available to PG&E's service territory via El Paso or via any other pipeline available to the shipper.

Subject:	Block III Recall Rights

Further to our discussions about our EPNG capacity: 

Our research had resulted in an opinion that there is little value associated with PG&E's (northern CA customers) recall rights on Block III capacity.  While it was not part of the original settlement, the 24 hour RE-recall rights to the shipper of record appear to give PG&E a DAILY call on capacity at best. 

Because we have pieced this opinion together based upon rulings in various proceedings, we would like a more formal regulatory/legal opinion of the mechanics of the RE-recall provision that has been developed over time. Is this something that either of you can provide or should it go to Randy? The results of this inquiry will set the tone of our next round of dicussions with EPNG.

 By the way, still waiting on their written reponse to our letter..... I think they have bigger fish to fry.

Please advise.

As we have discussed, ENA is trying to close a gas supply transaction with Citizens Gas in Arizona to provide gas supply to Citizens for ultimate delivery to PP&L for the Griffith power plant.  As part of this transaction, Enron Asset Management Resources (EAMR) would provide services to operate a pipeline that interconnects El Paso and Transwestern to the pipeline header system that ultimately interconnects with the Griffith power plant. To date, it has been the reasonable position of EAMR that its liability for services provided to Citizens should be ""capped"" at the sum of its annual fee of $144,000.  Citizens wants a $1,000,000 limit.  Citizens and EAMR have agreed to all aspects of the services deal except this liability question.  Although it might be possible to close our gas deal without EAMR, this is far from certain.  I have been trying to come up with an approach that would bridge this gap so that the ENA gas deal can be closed. 

This e-mail is intended to indicate the value of this transaction to Enron and get your viewpoint as to the feasibility and cost of one of two deal structures:

1)  ENA buys insurance to cover the cost of our buying a policy to bridge th gap in liability from $144,000 to $1,000,000.
2)  EAMR decides to increase the laibiltiy to $1,000,000 in return for increasing their earnings on the deal by the amount ENA would pay fior the insurance product - about $120,000.

ENA's preference is clearly for approach 2.

The attached spreadsheet indicates the value of this transaction to Enron.  ENA will earn approximately $3 million on the deal.  Please keep this number in confidence.  In addition, we have budgeted about $120,000 for the insurance product to increase the liability of EAMR from $140,000 to $1,000,000.

Can you please advise me as to the feasibility of 1) or 2) above?  If there is no way we are going to get there, I need to know fairly quickly so I can explore other options.  If it is possible, which of the above 2 approaches is better from you perspective?

Citizens will be here today at 3:00 pm.  I would greatly appreciate some feedback from you by that time.

To contact me please call Kim Ward at 713/853-0685 and she will be able to find me.

Thanks very much for you time.

Chris

an early meeting and or lunch  just to bring to a current status all the
legal,credit and commercial opportunities that should be reviewed.

Chad,  hope trading is going well.  Weather has been cool so I expect Sumas
basis has been tightening appropriately.   Per our conversation last week,
attached is my resume for your consideration.  Please pass on to the
appropriate people.   I am motivated in finding a position with a
progressive marketing company who could use my experience and knowledge of
the NW gas and electric market and where I can be part of a team that has
much larger view on the markets..   I definitely know that Enron fits that
model...

Thanks, Kevin

Subject:	LADWP Gas Contract


Dear Potential Gas Supplier

As some of you may know our authority to buy gas off our existing spot agreement
will come to an end on December 31, 2001.  While we will honor current
commitments for gas to be delivered after that date, but we will not be able to
use the spot agreement to buy any more gas.  The reason that this is happening
is that our City Attorney has interpreted the new City Charter as not allowing
delegations of authority such as employed in the way we buy gas now.

We are seeking approval for an ordinance which must be approved by the City
Council that will restore our former ability to buy gas with the kind of
agreement most gas suppliers are familiar.  We have the ordinance approved by
the City Attorney and it will shortly be in the pipeline for approval by our
Board and the City Council, but until then, this contract is a stop gap to keep
us operating.

I've attached the new contract and a cover letter which explains what we are
doing.  The deadline is November 8, 2001 at 4:00 PM.  We will take the executed
contracts to our Board with the counterparties listed on a Board Resolution and,
if it is approved, we will be allowed to buy gas from this group after the new
year begins.  This is not the ideal contract but one we feel our Board will be
comfortable with until we can get around the Charter problem.  I can't make any
changes to this contract.  There is a notice published in the LA Times about the
availability of the contract but I am sending it to you directly as someone we
have already done business with (and undoubtedly have satisfied all our
boilerplate requirements) and will probably be interested in what we are trying
to do here.

I Hope most of you will respond.  Thanks

     Barry: I will send a note to Jacy. Also the funds I think we will
go 
     into are going to be more heavily weighted towards stocks, but will
     
     have some bonds as well, that what makes them a balanced fund.
Also, 
     do want us to manage the money Jacy has, or do you want to leave it
     
     with him? No problem either way, just let me know.

I wasn't worried for a second.
     
I would like to have these funds in a portfolio that has a better 
performance than money markets. I already have a decent amount of money 
( 60K) in the Rice portfolio thru andrew agencies in Virden. You may 
want to look at exactly what that is, contact Jacy Whyte at Andrew 
Agencies... he will get you the details for Kim and I. 
     
Was there a particular index fund you had in mind? What do you mean by 
balanced ? Once we put it there I don't plan on touching or managing 
this until I return to Canada.  
     
Thanks, talk to you soon.

     Barry:
     
     You probably thought I had forgotten about you! I had not. I wanted
to 
     iron out some areas of concern from my end here. As you know, I am
not 
     supposed to do an investment for you while you are a resident of
the 
     US. I have discovered that if we put the money into an account and
not 
     make moves on it until you move back to Canada, then we can do it
if I 
     use a Canadian address. I was advised to put the money into a
balanced 
     fund and leave it there for now. My thoughts are to move it to a 
     couple of funds in a self administered account and NOT make any
moves 
     with it. 
     
     Please review this note, and let me know what you think. If all is
ok 
     I will mail you the forms to sign (which you signed here), and we
will 
     get this moving.
     
     Hope all is well with you down there.

Attached is the spreadsheet for billing Palo Alto.  I think that everything we need for billing purposes is there, we just need to improve it and make it user friendly.  We will provide this spreadsheet to accounting by the 10th of each month for the previous flow month. therefore, once we get August done, we will need to work on September.  Once you've had a chance to look at it, we can discuss.  Also, I have a notebook at my desk that details everything about Palo Alto.

No, I didn't receive this before. Regarding the plan for us to build credit
by selling day gas, yes, a bit more detail on the mechanics would help. Any
trading with Enron would have to be approved by my management. Regarding El
Paso, Gas Procurement needs to see what the utility's plan of reorganization
is before we can look at that seriously. The plan is due Dec 6 at the
latest. I have a call in to Eric LeDain regarding the Canadian contract, so
we should be getting to that soon.

nothing to do until Sat. when we go to Philly. I guess they decided rather
than pay us for sitting on our butts they would put us to work! I am not
particularly fond of their players. Some of them are OK. Joe Sakic is nice.
And of course, I got to see Rob Blake which was a plus. He just doesn't
look right in that Av uniform, or sitting on the plane in a different seat
with all of those ""other"" guys around him! Patrick Roy sits in the seat he
use to sit in with the Kings, so I guess we know who won out on that deal!
I sure wouldn't ask him to get up! Yikes, he scares me! Now, Bob Hartley,
he is THE nicest guy! And not bad to look at either! All of the coaches are
nice, and quite amusing! Until they lost last night I was hoping to take
them back to NJ this week. How awsome would that have been to bring them
home with THE cup on the plane! Now that it isn't going to happen that way
it is just as well we are not going out there. I guess they found some

As you all know, the recruiting season is in full swing and the AA Program's recruiters are hitting campus as we speak.  One of the most important parts of the process and a key to Enron's future success are the Fantastic Friday and Super Saturday interview dates where we make the selections on those candidates who will receive offers from Enron for the 2002 recruiting class.  It is important that these candidates be interviewed by business leaders from each business unit and specifically those who utilize AA pool members.  Our goal is for each business unit to identify a core group of interviewers for each of the four interview weekends which will be held as follows:

		Dates						Total Number of Interviewers Needed**

October 25-26           Fantastic Friday - Analysts			100		30 for dinner/70 for interview        
November 2 -4 -        Super Saturday - Associates		100		30 for dinner/70 for interview		
November 15-16        Fantastic Friday - Analysts			100		30 for dinner/70 for interview
November 30-Dec 1   Super Saturday - Associates		100		30 for dinner/70 for interview

I have attached a list of those individuals in various business units that have participated in the interview process in the past for your review (as a sample of the type of individual we are looking for as interviewers).  Please provide me a list of your business unit's interviewers by date by Friday, October 5.  Individuals are encouraged to interview more than one selected date and we will forward details to them at least a week prior to the interview date.  If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to give me a call.  Thanks again for all your help.  Ted and Traci

 
**  We do not expect you to provide all the interviewers.  This number reflects to total needed from all business units and will include those needed for both the evening and interview days..

Key Enron Employees Aren't Jumping Ship, Recruiters Say
Dow Jones International News Service via Dow Jones
By Michael Rieke Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES
HOUSTON (Dow Jones)--Enron Corp.'s (ENE) current problems aren't sending its
key employees running for the door, according to two executive recruiters.
While employees at Enron's underperforming units are shopping around for new
jobs, those working for its core wholesale energy trading and retail energy
units seem content, the recruiters told Dow Jones Newswires.
""We've been getting resumes from their international group over the last
year,"" said Bruce Peterson, managing director for Korn Ferry in Houston.
""But its been a very well-known fact that they're getting out of those
businesses.""
Another Houston recruiter, who didn't want to be identified, said he has
gotten ""a flood"" of resumes from employees at Enron's natural gas and power
assets in South America.
Employees at Enron's broadband unit are also sending out resumes, said the
recruiter. That business has brought the company losses of more than $100
million this year despite hundreds of layoffs. Enron continues to cut costs
in its telecom business.
Neither recruiter has seen many resumes from Enron's big moneymakers - the
wholesale energy trading group and the retail energy services group.
Some of the lower-level employees of those units have sent out resumes but
Peterson said he hasn't seen higher-level executives in the job market.
However, he attached a caveat to that statement.
""Quite a few of the senior people at Enron have left over the last 6-12
months,"" he said.
When Enron's share price was flying high last year and early this year, some
of Enron's top executives cashed out their stock options and left the
company.
Those executives included Cliff Baxter, former vice chairman and chief
strategy officer; Ken Rice, former head of Enron Capital and Trade as well
as former chief executive of Enron Broadband Services; Kevin Hannon, former
president of Enron Broadband Services; and Lou Pai, former chairman and
chief executive of Enron Energy Services.
The lure of cashing out lucrative stock options won't cost Enron any more
employees any time soon. The company's share price has fallen too far too
quickly, leaving the options underwater.
The company's shares traded as high as $80 early this year. By July the
price had dropped to around $50, leaving employees with options that were
virtually worthless. So Enron told employees it would issue new options in
August.
But the company's share price continued to fall as more and more bad news
came out. The new options issued in August, when the share prices were
around $40, are now underwater also.
Now that the options are out of the money, Enron employees are more
vulnerable to the lure of other companies, Peterson said.
Enron could face another problem in keeping key people. Its employees work
under two-year contracts. If they leave Enron before their contracts
expires, a noncompete clause could prevent them for working for a
competitor.
Some of those contracts will expire at the end of the year. Without the
incentive of lucrative stock options, Enron might have a difficult time
getting employees to agree to new contracts with a noncompete clause,
Peterson said.
An Enron spokeswoman said the company isn't planning to issue more new
options to employees.

Hi Dave,

As we've been running our numbers on this proposal, I was curious if your
offer of $13MM factors in any kind of tax make-up for the up-front payment?
I'm continuing to try to identify where we have differences in value so we
can discuss further tomorrow.  By the way, I think there will be 3 to 4 of
us tomorrow:

Myself
Tim Miller - Origination (Southwest)
Bill Burden - Business Development Gas and Power
Kim Colburn - Business Development Gas and Power

Give me a call and we can set up a place to meet in front of the restaurant
- they won't seat anyone until everyone is there anyway.

Penny,

We do not have a hard deadline for placing this capacity, however, some
of it has already been spoken for.   We could do something as early as
Nov 01 but I understand that may be a bit aggressive.  Our offer
currently stands at about $13MM for 100,000/day, Nov 01 - May 06.  We
will look to you to take on the obligation for that payment or make us a
counter offer.  We would be happy to sit down with you as early as next
week to work through any questions or issues.  I hope that answers your
question, please let me know if it doesn't.

Dave

PS - I'll be in Houston next week if a meeting would be useful.

Just wanted to clarify what kind of deadline your aiming for with this
transport proposal.  The reason I am asking is I have taken this to the
next
level and we will probably need several days to run through our internal
processes.  I know you are working with multiple parties so if you let
me
know how you would like to proceed then we can be working on a similar

Hey Penny,

One more thought on the EPNG capacity valuation we've been discussing...
physical gas in the San Juan is selling at a discount to index,
therefore we are incorporating that into our valuation.  I thought you
might want to consider that as well. 

Thanks,

Generally, the seller of an option does NOT incur taxable income on the receipt of an option premium.  Instead, the option premium is held as an ""open transaction"" (ie. no current tax consequences) until the option is exercised, sold/terminated in a closing transaction, or lapses.  Similarly, the purchaser of an option does not get an immediate tax deduction when it pays an option premium.  

The ultimate tax impact to the option seller and purchaser depends on what happens with the underlying option.  For example, if the option is exercised, then the option seller adds the option premium to the strike price to determine the total amount realized on the sale of the underlying commodity.  (This total amount realized is then used to determine whether the seller has taxable gain or loss on the underlying sale).  From the option purchaser's perspective, the option premium is added to the strike price to determine its tax basis in the underlying commodity.

In the case where the option is allowed to lapse, the option seller treats the option premium as taxable income on the date that the option lapses.  Similarly, the option purchaser takes a deduction for the option premium on the date that the option lapses.

Hopefully this gives you a little bit of an overview of the general rules governing the taxation of options.  Notwithstanding the above overview, I would still like to visit with you regarding the proposed transaction as there are certain ""exceptions"" or ""nuances"" to the general rules that could apply.  As such, once you have had a chance to review, please give me a call at ext. 3-5846 so that we can discuss further.  Thanks.

Morris... if ENA were to sell options to a third party and receive the option premium up front... for example $ 10MM $'s.... would that be considered taxable income?

We would also be buying the option from another party or hedging this structure and this cash would be used to offset future liabilities related to the deal.

We also attach a blackline of the agreement which separately indicates these most recent changes (as compared to the version which we sent to you on July 3, 2001)(the ""Incremental Blackline"").

The Incremental Blackline includes a number of changes which address concerns communicated by Ray Welch.  Most importantly, we have removed the concept of set-off of obligations of the affiliates of non-defaulting parties.  We have also reinserted the concept of ""Interruptible"" transactions; however, we have clarified that ""Baseload Gas"", ""Multi-Month Gas"" and ""Swing Gas"" transactions shall be firm.

In addition to the foregoing, we have proposed a number of other amendments which help clarify the representations, obligations and transacting procedures under the agreement.  For example, we have distinguished payment defaults from other failures as events constituting ""Defaults"".

Similarly, we have amended the confirmation procedures of Article 2 to clarify the mechanics of transacting.  As you saw in our previous comments, Enron Canada wants to clarify that, although the practice is to always send a Confirmation Notice, a transaction is not dependent on a Confirmation Notice.  In addition, the Incremental Blackline includes amendments which eliminate the potential confusion/uncertainty which would arise in the event that Confirmation Notices were issued by both parties.  Section 2.4 has been amended such that only one party confirms the transactions.  In this case, because Enron Canada will be issuing the Confirmation Notices for all Enron Online transactions, we have inserted Enron Canada as the party to issue the Confirmation Notice for all transactions, subject to a three business day review period. 

Should you have any questions or concerns relating to our proposed changes prior to the meeting, please give me a call.  You can reach me directly at (403) 974-6708.

What I need to know is the legal status/issues ( if any ) of any of the companies listed here today as it relates to the state of California. 
Pan Canadian Energy Services, Occidental Energy Marketing, Dynegy Marketing and Trading , Texaco Natural Gas, BP Amoco, and Coast Energy Group. 

Can you advise If any of these companies form part of ongoing legal action against the state?

As promised, here are some of the current redeployment candidates that have a marketing/structuring/trading background for consideration concerning your West Origination opening.  I believe that you have seen Jim Lowe before and expressed some limited interest in him.  The other candidates are most likely new to you.

Let me know if you would like to pursue any of these redeployed employees.


     

Also, I spoke with Mark McConnell today, and he mentioned that he had accepted the offer to join the Transwestern group of ETS.  He primary motivation for selection of this option was his desire to work with asset deals.  As we know, given EWS ""asset light"" approach to deal making, this option would be difficult to fulfill within the West Origination group.  However, he mentioned that he was very impressed with your group, and short of the asset piece maintained a high interest in your open position.

Regards,
Todd Peikert"

John, here is a brief summary of the Williston Basin Storage.... The numbers don't lie... the cushion gas is 160Bcf in the ground sitting idle. It is huge..with 20 bcf of working gas!  Is that some idle capital or what?   

.. There is alot of history here and Mark Whitt and I have been discussing structures/ideas. I will update you immediatly if we are able to kindle something.  

Pls advise if any direct / comments.

Is this what you think John wants to see, or should we go into more detail?  I tried to get the storage guys a meeting with these guys earlier in the summer but I was not successful.  I do not know if they were ever successful in getting that meeting.  I do not think so.

Boys,  
I am bored today and have proof to show you... 
Go to this website and type in 1031 in the sale number field..
It's a beauty and would be a fine addition to any collector's gallery.
I would consider a joint venture with you for investment purposes on this
find of a lifetime.
Personally, I think it looks a little like a late 70's drummer but it is the
Great One nonetheless. 
It is a fine specimen of the era ' Short on the sides, but keep the length
in the back'

Subject:	Update on the EPNG events of 9/11-13

Hi, everyone. Sorry for the delay in responding to all the messages and
emails regarding the meetings sponsored by SRP. There were a few people who
were in Phoenix before the WTC disaster and we did meet on Wednesday to do
some brainstorming. This email is an attempt to share the discussions with
those of you who were not here.

The parties who met were SRP, APS, PD, SWG, SoCal and the ACC. Joel Greene,
Barbara Jost, Kelly Daly and Dave Huard were here as legal counsel and Greg
Lander was here as a consultant. There are no new proposals on the table. We
did discuss ways to get to a point where we might be able to talk settlement
and whether or not parties might be willing to turn back capacity. No
surprise that we keep coming back to ""what do you use to allocate the
existing capacity"". Greg is going to run some numbers for the EOC based on
different starting scenarios using the assumption that CD capacity will be
made available at some level. He will also be looking at the impact of
seasonalizing the EOC loads.

SRP will reschedule the meetings (or arrange a conference call) to discuss
settlement once we have Greg's analysis. I wouldn't expect anything before
the end of September unless it is a conference call.

Thanks to everyone for letting me know your status during the week. It was a
relief to know everyone was safe somewhere.

Kids are doing well... my boys turned 1 in September and running rampant
around our house... the rest of the family including myself are scared of
them.  Olivia turned 4 recently and has quite a British accent now... I
sometimes wonder where she came from.
Josee has her hands full at home right now and after a weekend I am more
than ready to return to the office for rest.  
Markets have been choppy... my trading strategy over the past 2 months has
been very simple however.. as Randolph Duke said in the OJ futures pit on
Trading Places... SELL MORTIMER SELL.


Will send you a picture soon.. 
say hi to the wife for us.

PS-  took some clients up to play Turnberry in September for a few days...
what a peach, you would have LOVED it...

Feudalism
You have two cows.
Your lord takes some of the milk.

----------

Fascism
You have two cows.
The government takes both, hires you to take care of them and sells you
the
milk.

----------

Pure Communism
You have two cows.
Your neighbours help take care of them and you all share the milk.

----------

Applied Communism
You have two cows.
You must take care of them, but the government takes all the milk.

----------

Totalitarianism
You have two cows.
The government takes them both and denies they ever existed. Milk is
banned.

----------

Pure Democracy
You have two cows.
You and your neighbours decide who gets the milk.

----------

Representative Democracy
You have two cows.
Your neighbours pick someone to tell you who gets the milk.

Mexican Democracy
You have two cows.
The government takes both and drafts you into the army.


----------

European Democracy
You have two cows.
The EU commission decides which regulations for feeding and milking
apply.
If
there aren't any, they invent some. They pay you not to milk the cows.
They take both cows, shoot one, milk the other and pour the milk down
the
drain.
They then require you to fill out forms accounting for the missing cows.


----------

American Democracy
The government promises to give you two cows, if you vote for it.
After the election, the president is impeached for speculating in cow
futures.
The press dubs the affair ""cowgate,"" but supports the president.
The cows sue you for breach of contract.
Your legal bills exceed your annual income.
You settle out of court and declare bankruptcy.


----------


Capitalism
You have two cows.
You sell one and buy a bull.
Your herd multiplies, and the economy grows. You sell them and retire on
the
income.


----------

Enron Venture Capitalism
You have two cows.
You sell three of them to your publicly listed company, using letters of
credit
opened by your brother-in-law at the bank, then execute a debt/equity
swap
with
an associated general offer so that you get all four cows back, with a
tax
exemption for five cows.  The milk rights of the six cows are
transferred
via an
intermediary to a Cayman Island company secretly owned by the majority
shareholder who sells the rights to all seven cows back to your listed
company.
The annual report says the company owns eight cows, with an option on
one
more.

I do know Pete Cervin, and I also know the Amoco attorney as well as the outside counsel who will be representing them.  If the FERC data base is up to date (not always the case), there weren't that many other parties who protested.  I'll check their filings, too.

If we decide to join with Burlington and Amoco/BP, we would probably need to sign some sort of agreement on splitting expenses for outside counsel and any consultants.  This would make it more difficult to back out so we'd need to be sure before we committed.

I'll let you know what it looks like after I've had a chance to review all the filings.

The major thing that got the CPUC in the settlement was the recall rights of Block II which assured that the former PG&E customers would always have firm rights to cheap gas - at least for the term of the settlement.  Removing them would require a tariff change, and I can't see the CPUC agreeing.

Subject:	Turnback of EPNG Capacity
Importance:	High
Sensitivity:	Confidential

I have had several conversations with EPNG about the possibility of ENA turning back capacity to satisfy 1) requests for new capacity in the Power Up 2000 project and 2) any possible capacity that EPNG may need to provide to satisfy incremental needs of full requirements customers as they convert billing determinants to Contract Demand quantities.

In order to preserve our position, should I send a formal letter to Al Clark stating our desire to turn the capacity back? The Power Up 2000 deadline is noon, Thursday, August 2, 2001. They did not provide for turn back in the posting that is currently on the capacity system. While we do not know how EPNG will be forced to resolve their capacity issues in the receipt point allocation proceeding, I believe that a letter can help us preserve our position should we choose to turn back capacity under either scenario.

We have approx. 54,000 of Block I and III capacity and 200,000 of Block III capacity. The Block II capacity is subject to PG&E recall - PG&E paid approx. $58 million for those recall rights in a settlement. Could EPNG pay a negotiated sum of money for the remaining value of the recall rights to fund the needs full requirement customers? I have to believe this option would be cheaper than adding new  capacity.

Leslie - could you help me with the letter?

Many thanks!

Subject:	El Paso Natural Gas Company Dockets RP00-336, RP01-484, RP01-486,	 RP00-139
Importance:	High

Salt River Project, in an effort to bring resolution to the mainline and
receipt point allocation issues pending in the above-captioned proceedings,
is filing today (and serving hard copies of) the attached ""Motion of SRP for
Adoption of Strawman Alternative to March 28, 2000 Proposal of El Paso
Natural Gas Company"".  Unlike any other proposal before it, it seeks to
weave into one workable solution, the concerns raised by shippers in their
initial and reply comments filed in the Order 637 proceeding, as well as
address the 3 complaints.  It is a share-the-pain proposal among CD -
Converted FR - and El Paso.  Under it, FR shippers would convert to CDs at
levels reflecting actual usage over the past 5 years, weighted to the
present. It assures each westward flowing firm shipper, based on the current
physical mainline capacity (including L. 2000), 93.1%(winter) and 94.2%
(summer) of their contractual entitlement.  On a daily basis, all westward
FT shippers are assured of receiving approximately 60% of their 93.1 and
94.2% allocation from the San Juan.  FT-2 shippers would continue to be
served off the top.  This Strawman adopts the in-line pooling methodology
set forth in SoCal Gas' initial comments.  It includes North and South
system segmentation rights, and narrowly defined demand charge credits for
unprovided capacity as long as there is a shortfall.  Provision is made to
encourage turn-back of capacity and to have capacity under expired contracts
dedicated by El Paso to meeting the approximately 7% shortfall. Provision is
also made to treat each primary delivery point as a receipt point, and to
give priority to Alternate Receipt- to- Primary Delivery point in the
systemwide scheduling process, all intended to encourage a strong
supplemental market to meet peak seasonal needs.

This Strawman Alternative is not filed as an offer of settlement, but as a
basis for a merits decision, eliminating the need for lengthy evidentiary
hearings, and providing certainty and flexibility to the system once
implemented.  Alternatively, we have left it to the Commission to decide
whether other procedures should be adopted.  Because it is a motion, it may
be responded to within 15 days of filing.  SRP strongly urges each shipper
and state commission to contact SRP for answers to any questions before
taking a position in response to the motion.  Any shipper that has questions
but does not seek answers, but merely sticks to their litigation position
will only be delaying resolution. This proposal is a viable
compromise...everyone gains and everyone loses something.  That is why it
works.  We look forward to hearing from you and reading your constructive
comments.  Joel Greene

Jeff, I was talking to Mike Etringer yesterday regarding this subject and he gave me the name of the CFO Ted Craver. I understand that you guys were dealing with John Fielder.  
 
For sure we want to know what they are up to.  I think like all deals in California we are going to run into issues with credit, and probably paper but that would pretty much depend on the counterparty. ( is it edison), or DWR? 
 
It is VERY important that trading and marketing are aware of the hedging activities in a very timely fashion so however we need to ensure that happens will be my plan. 
 
Do you know the CFO ?

It was a pleasure to discuss the upcoming gas supply needs of DWR and the
potential supply options that Enron may be able to provide . I am interested
in further exploring the discounted transportation/ supply program we
briefly discussed at this week's meeting. As for the payables, DWR is
following standard payment terms; the latter of 10 days after receipt of
invoice or the 25th of the month following delivery. DWR would not agree to
accelerating payments. Additionally, please be advised that DWR would be
contemplating relatively short term transactions with Enron at this time. If
you have any questions, please do not hesitate to call.

I have attached a breakdown of our gas inventories by location.  The valuations have not been updated to take into account the downward move in gas prices.  

When we meet with you here in Purchase we would like to this to be one of the topics of discussion.  If you need any additional information (or more detail), please let me know asap.

Concur Expense (XMS)
Common Questions


1.  Where can I find online documentation on Concur Expense?
Answer: Documentation on Concur Expense is stored in the ISC Document Library.   Go to the following link:
http://isc.enron.com/site/doclibrary/user/default.asp  and click on the XMS - Concur Expense folder on the left.

2. How can I sign up for Concur Expense training and how much does it cost?
Answer: Go to the following link: http://iscedcenter.enron.com/docentlm/login.htm.  Log in using your Enron email address.  Enter your birth date as the password in the following format: MMDDYYYY.  Under the Courses section, select Concur Expense (XMS).  This will show the training schedule.  Click the Enroll button to sign up for a class.  The cost is $250.

3. Will old XMS expense reports be converted to the new Concur Expense system?
Answer: No.  History data was not converted to the new system because of our move to an Application Service Provider (ASP) solution for Concur Expense.

4. How can I view my old expense reports?
Answer: Call the ISC Customer Care group at 713-345-4727.  The ISC will be responsible for printing out old expense reports and forwarding them to you.  Other options are being reviewed to allow you to view old expense reports.

5. Are there any Enron specific help instructions for Concur Expense?
Answer: Yes.  If you log into Concur Expense, you will see a link to Enron Help on the Concur Expense home page under the Company Links section.  Also you will see a button for Enron Help at the top of the screen when entering expense reports.

6. Is Enron's Travel Policy available in Concur Expense?
Answer: Yes. If you log into Concur Expense, you will see a link to Travel Policy on the Concur Expense home page under the Company Links section.  Also you will see a button for Travel Policy at the very top of the screen when entering expense reports

7. What if I am unable to see any of my credit card charges in Concur Expense?
Answer: Since there are a number of factors that could cause this problem, it is best to call the ISC Customer Care group first.  The ISC will research the problem and get back to you with an answer.

8. Does Concur Expense have a time-out feature?
Answer: Yes.  Concur Expense will automatically time out after 20 minutes of inactivity.

9. How do I enter foreign currency into Concur Expense?
Answer: Go to the ISC Document Library described in #1 above.  Go to the XMS - Concur Expense folder.  Next go to the Special Procedures folder and following the directions stated in the document called Add a Foreign Currency Expense to an Expense Report.

10. Are there any other sources to quickly get me started using Concur Expense?
Answer: Yes.  Concur Expense provides a Quick Tour for new users.  Log into Concur Expense and click the Help button in the top right corner of the screen.  Then click the button labeled Quick Tour at the top of the help screen.  The ISC intranet home page also contains some helpful information.  The following link summarizes some of the topics discussed above:  http://isc.dev.corp.enron.com/site/XMSchange.htm.

11. Can you quickly describe some of the internal changes in the new Concur Expense system?
Answer:  There are minimal changes in the new upgrade.  Here is a list:
?	The first screen only has one tab instead of two
?	New expense types were added
?	Attendees and approvers will now be printed on the expense reports
?	Manager and receipt dunning notices will be sent out
?	The statistical order and statistical WBS element fields have been separated out


Please direct all other questions to the ISC Customer Care group at 713-345-4727."

Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

If you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out.

Happy New Year

Subject: Kern River Transportation Management - Aug 1


As a reminder...EFFECTIVE AUG 1. ENA has appointed Nevada Power / Sierra Pacific as our agent for the term of the transportation agreement. What this means is that NP will nominate the supply gas into the pipeline and deliver to themselves as they are the market for the whole volume and term. ENA will have to instruct NP what our supply looks like ( on a daily basis) 
 
We have sold all the Kern gas to SPPC for the entire period.... at a Socal Monthly Index minus $.42/$.95 related price and our obligation is 100% takes.
 
I know some supply has been purchased for the term but some gas will be procured in the spot market.  I expect that Steve South and Paul Lucci will coordinate those efforts as required but we need this gas to show up every day.  
 
Let me know if there are any questions regarding this note... but primary supply and market obligations are in the hands of the trading group.

In order to preserve our position, should I send a formal letter to Al Clark stating our desire to turn the capacity back? The Power Up 2000 deadline is noon, Thursday, August 2, 2001. They did not provide for turn back in the posting that is currently on the capacity system. While we do not know how EPNG will be forced to resolve their capacity issues in the receipt point allocation proceeding, I believe that a letter can help us preserve our position should we choose to turn back capacity under either scenario.

We have approx. 54,000 of Block I and III capacity and 200,000 of Block III capacity. The Block II capacity is subject to PG&E recall - PG&E paid approx. $58 million for those recall rights in a settlement. Could EPNG pay a negotiated sum of money for the remaining value of the recall rights to fund the needs full requirement customers? I have to believe this option would be cheaper than adding new  capacity.

Leslie - could you help me with the letter?

They seem very positive about the project at this point and have obviously spent a lot of money on right -of-way, regulatory filings, enviornmental and engineering work.  I had previously put this project at a very low probablility, especially with the 900 MM/d Kern expansion in 2003.  I did not think that they would be able to get Williams Marketing to take a substantial part of this capacity.  However, they are making the production company bear the costs of the capacity.  Obviously that is the key to Williams being able to have a shot at making this project a reality. 

Williams is in negotiaitions to fill the other 175,000 mmbtu/d.  I have to put that probability at still fairly low, but stranger things have happened, especially if Williams decides to go at risk for some portion of the 540 MM/d.  Probably the entire project is still less than 50% but it is obviously something to monitor very closely.

If the project gets built it will substantially effect the basis market for CIG and Northwest.  Especially on the heels of the Kern River expansion. In addition, the Cheyenne market will definitely strengthen in the back years.

Call if you want to discuss or have other ideas about how to monitor these developments.

Mark,

Steph said you were looking for some info on the Western Frontier project that was in NGI today.  I called the contact person at Western Frontier/Williams and he told me that the project was not in fact fully subscribed.  He was obviously interested in speaking with you again.  

I glanced through their filing, and apparently the open season led to PAs for 365,000 Dth/d of the 540,000 Dth/d of available capacity.  PA  have been signed with the following:

Marathon - 75,000 dth/d
Williams Marketing - 200,000 dth/d
Utilicorp United - 15,000 dth/d
Entergy - 75,000 dth/d

With the exception of Marathon, everyone signed up for ten years.  Marathon committed to five years, with an option to extend for two years.  

Let me know if you need anything else.

Phil

John indicated he would be willing to conference in with Gerald and Kern's attorney(s) first thing Monday morning if we felt it would be helpful.

Paul-- I was in Phoenix the last week of August at an Arizona Corporation Commission (ACC) meeting on price risk managment for gas supply. Leslie Lawner from our gov affairs group had drafted comments for the meeting and attended as well.  During the discussion there was a question from one of the Commissioners to Sourthwest Gas asking why they were not looking into developing a gas storage site.  I believe that Leslie has been talking to Miguel in your group and that possibly there is a meeting set in the near future to discuss development of storage with Southwest Gas?

We have developed a good relationship with several of Governor Hull's staffers, one of whom was at the meeting.  He expressed to me later a strong interest in gas storage development and opined that more  gas storage could be very helpful to the region. It would be helpful for me if I could set up a call between you or whoever would be most knowledgeable on the development of gas storage in your group and the Governor's staffer (Craig Marks) so that he can get a sense of what the real financial/physical/regulatory issues are in such a development.  He has a close relationship with the ACC, and could very well be helpful in moving something forward if we had a strong interest in doing something to move gas storage development in Arizona.

Could you give me a call to discuss?  #612-339-4599.  Thanks."

Battle lines drawn over long-term power deals 
SD Union Tribune, 10.07.01 
In a perverse sign that normalcy is returning, the state's power crisis roared back to life last week with the California Public Utilities Commission as the focus. 

This time the state utilities commission pulled off a feat few could have anticipated, even from a long-running crisis that has caused blackouts and soaring electricity costs. 

In a span of three hours last week, the five-member panel went from being applauded by consumer groups and blasted by industry interests to being vilified by consumer advocates and applauded by business. 

Consumer advocates celebrated when the PUC refused to rubber stamp state-negotiated long-term power contracts, a move the governor said stalled the $12.5 billion bond offering needed to cover past power purchases. 

But business leaders and the governor cheered the PUC for approving a $3.3 billion rescue of Southern California Edison, which consumer advocates criticized as an unauthorized bailout. 

As massive as the Edison deal is, it may be less likely to affect customers of SDG&E than the second reality that emerged last week: Despite the PUC action on the contracts, Californians still face the burden of paying more than $40 billion over the next two decades for overpriced and possibly unneeded electricity. 

Or maybe not. 
While electricity providers continue to defend the long-term power contracts as fair and key to resolving the state's electricity crisis, consumer groups and others have launched a major offensive to get the contracts revised, renegotiated or canceled. 

Critics argue that the deals were negotiated while the state's economy was reeling, blackouts were striking and federal regulators were insisting that the state had to tie up the bulk of its electricity needs through long-term deals. 

Duress alleged 
Consumer advocates say the long-term contracts bind California to power purchases at more than double current market prices and force the state to buy power it does not need. 

""We should not be stuck with these agreements because conditions have changed so dramatically,"" said Bill Ahern, a senior analyst with Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports magazine. ""We did these agreements under duress, and it is better for the generators and us to negotiate what all believe is a good deal."" 

Ahern also said an investigation of possible conflicts of interest for at least one member of the state team that negotiated the contracts could lead to their invalidation. 

Michael Shames, executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network in San Diego, notes that much of the power to be delivered under the agreements will come from new plants yet to be built in California. 

""The state has the ability through the siting process to modify those contracts,"" Shames said. The motivation to do so could grow soon, he added. 

""Especially in an election year, the question will be whether elected officials and the public will tolerate the (cost) of these contracts,"" Shames said. 

Shames noted that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission pressed California to lock up much of its power under long-term contracts, because it argued that excessive reliance on short-term purchases was a major contributor to the power crisis. 

Now it appears the cost of that solution could exceed the cost of the short-term crisis, Shames said. 
Beyond the growing political pressure, San Diego attorney Michael Aguirre is arguing in appellate court that Gov. Gray Davis overstepped his legal authority by declaring an emergency and signing the long-term agreements in the first place. 

He says California's electricity deals violate state law regarding purchasing practices. 
""To circumvent that law by calling it an emergency does not pass legal muster,"" said Aguirre, who is suing electricity providers for overcharging. ""There were other means to manage the emergency."" 

The PUC also says the state locked itself into too much power for too long a period. 
""First and foremost, we should try to renegotiate, try to get shorter terms,"" said Gary Cohen, general counsel for the PUC.

Willingness to deal 
At least two major suppliers have indicated a willingness to discuss the matter, Cohen said. The PUC also will continue to press for changes to the agreements with FERC. 

The federal commission regulates wholesale power markets and is legally mandated to ensure prices are ""just and reasonable."" FERC is considering refunds for prices paid by California in spot power markets during the crisis. 

Cohen argues that if spot prices are subject to refunds, long-term contracts should be subject to similar relief. The PUC has made several filings pressing this point, but has received no response from FERC. 

For his part, the governor declines to call for renegotiation of the contracts. 
""In order to renegotiate we would have to have the generator come to us, and they have not done so,"" said Steve Maviglio, the governor's spokesman. ""We would be pleased to sit down and renegotiate. But we have not been approached by anyone."" 

Some experts believe Davis wants to break the contracts more than he is willing to say, but he must maintain credibility with the providers with whom he signed agreements. The same people speculate that the governor, who blasted the PUC last week for failing to help implement the agreements, may have privately welcomed the commission's action as a step toward revising the agreements. 

Power providers, meanwhile, continue to support the agreements. 
""The contracts are good for the state and helped stabilize the market,"" said William Highlander, director of public relations for Calpine Corp. 

The San Jose company is the largest provider under the controversial agreements, with some $13 billion in contracts. Calpine hopes to provide much of that power from new plants it is building within California. 

Sempra says contract fair 
The company has not been approached by the state to revise its agreements, said Highlander, and he declined to say how Calpine would respond to such an overture. 

San Diego-based Sempra Energy, another major provider under the agreements, also insists its contracts provide power at fair rates to the state. 

Michael Niggli, president of Sempra Energy Resources, said his company will provide power for about 4 to 5 cents per kilowatt hour, based upon current natural gas prices. 

""It's pretty tough to say, 'Let's renegotiate the lowest price contract,' "" Niggli said. 
But V. John White, director of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies, said Sempra's contract and others lock the state into power that consumers are unlikely to need, and too much of the electricity comes from non-renewable sources. 

White says state consumers are being held hostage by some unnecessary posturing. 
""There are indications from several generators that a call to renegotiate would be responded to,"" White said. ""The generators say nobody asked us. The governor says nobody has volunteered. 

""But the opportunity is there at this moment to renegotiate. Why don't we ask?"" 
***************************************************************** 
State authority buying more power for 2002 
Critics say it's too costly, perhaps unnecessary and may be sold off later at a loss 
OC Register, 10.07.01 
SACRAMENTO -- California's new power agency is rushing to buy more electricity for next summer, even as the state has come under fire for buying too much costly power and then having to sell it at bargain prices. 

Moreover, another state agency says the state will have enough power - because of existing contracts and conservation - to get through the hottest of summers next year. 

The new power purchases, which are being negotiated by the California Public Power and Financing Authority, could add as much as 3,000 megawatts of power to California - enough for about 2.3 million homes - by June. That would be in addition to the existing $43 billion in long-term agreements the state has already inked with power generators. 

Many observers - even those supportive of the power authority's goal to increase cleaner, alternative energy sources in the state - are balking at the agency's rapid pace, saying consumers will end up paying more in the long run. 

""We're dumping power and (authority Chairman) David Freeman is buying more power. What's up with that? It's absolutely ludicrous,'' said Harry Snyder, executive director of Consumers' Union, which publishes Consumer Reports. 

A draft report by the California Energy Commission shows the state already has plenty of power for next year. 
Without the extra power being negotiated by the power authority, even in a very hot summer, the state would have about 6,000 extra megawatts during peak periods, when it needs 63,800 megawatts, about a 9 percent cushion. That is if all power plants came online as expected and residents continued to conserve as they are. 

In a normal summer, such as this year's, the state would have 10,000 extra megawatts above the average 59,000 megawatts it needs, roughly a 17 percent surplus. 

Power authority officials counter that those surplus figures are estimates that depend on people conserving at the rate they did this summer. ""The more we own of our own supply, the more we can control the market,'' said state Treasurer Phil Angelides, an authority board member. 

Said Freeman: ""We are thinking our way through what we should do for next summer. That why we get paid the big bucks."" 
New contracts would increase 'green' power 
In addition, at least one-third of the new energy the power authority is trying to buy - 1,000 megawatts - would come from solar, wind and other renewable energy providers, officials said. 

Such generators were left out when the state signed its initial round of contracts. Bringing on 1,000 more megawatts would increase the portion of the state's energy derived from renewable resources to 13 percent. The long-term goal is 17 percent. 

The remaining power purchased under the new contracts, perhaps 2,000 megawatts, would be from so-called ""peaker'' plants - less efficient jet-engine-like generators that are turned on only during emergency shortages. 

The emphasis on these natural gas plants irks many environmentalists, but proponents of them say these would be a new generation of gas peakers. While not preferable to conventional generating plants, they would pollute less than the peakers currently being pressed into service. If California can build new, more efficient ones, it can retire the old polluting ones, the argument goes. 

Nonetheless, critics fear the state, rushing into new negotiations, will leave ratepayers with more expensive power contracts. They note that the authority hasn't completed an assessment on exactly how much power it really needs and what it wants for the state's power portfolio. That assessment won't be done until February. 

""I hope they have a basis on which they've determined they need those (3,000) megawatts of contracts,'' said Lenny Goldberg, a lobbyist for The Utility Reform Network, a consumer watchdog group. 

Businesses worry new pacts will hurt them 
Even the state's businesses are critical. 
They believe that the more expensive long-term power there is under state contract, the less likely lawmakers are to businesses go into the open market to buy the cheaper electricity they think they can get there. 

Lawmakers, they believe, will want to force businesses to continue to buy power under the contracts they've negotiated because if the businesses were allowed to pull out, residential customers alone would be left paying the higher prices that those contracts dictate. 

Lawmakers are reluctant to put any more burdens on the average consumer, who they feel are the unintended victims of a severely flawed deregulation system. 

""I would just as soon not see them negotiate any more contracts,'' said Jack Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers and Technology Association. 

The state power authority was signed into law in May to build its own plants, help others finance them and compete with the private power companies. Leading the $5 million-a-year agency is Freeman, the former head of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power and one of Davis' closest advisers during the energy crisis. 

The Legislature's auditors are casting a critical eye at the power authority and will hold hearings next month. 
""It's not an investigation,'' said Assemblyman Fred Keeley, D-Felton, chairman of the Joint Legislative Audit Committee. But ""it's appropriate early and often to review their work in a public venue and have them held accountable for compliance of the law.'' 

Keeley's committee is looking into the planned purchases and he said he could not yet conclude whether the power authority's actions could help or hurt the state. 

Freeman said onlookers have been too quick to criticize the state's work. 
""The plain truth is we had blackouts last winter. We did what we could. We kept the rates stable and lights on,'' Freeman said. ""Criticism is real easy with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight.''"

Hey Paul----I did get together with Barry Tycholiz this afternoon when I was in Houston to review the matrix that we have on price risk management initiatives and current practice at the state PUCs in the west.  As you know, the matrix is a starting point, and I encouraged Barry to take a stronger look at his opportunities in each state and that we would do further spade work in those states as he identifies his prospects.  We talked about 3 states that he has initial interest in--- California (Barry is already talking to Dasovich and I will touch base with Jeff tomorrow to follow up), Colorado and Nevada.  

I will be reviewing the proposed rulemaking in Colorado in the next few days and will send Barry and Mark Whitt an outline of what the issues boil down to so that we can have a discussion on how active/what strategy we might want us to pursue at the PUC.  As you will recall, we have the opportunity to submit comments until the end of October. While the appetite for taking sustantive action on PRM in at the Commision is limited (only the Chair has a strong interest--his other two commissioners are skeptical and the primary staff person has been quite negative), Barry is not adverse to considering a long shot position.

Although we didn't get into alot of detail on Nevada, Barry is in discussions with Sierra on gas supply and I indicated that you had past experience and ongoing relationships with both the Nevada commission and Sierra and could be a great resource for him.  Could you please give him a call (#713-853-1587) when you get a chance.  Thanks!  

I think you're in meetings most of the day tomorrow, but if you get a chance, catch up with me. I am back in Minnesota.

Subject:	Enron Center Garage

The Enron Center Garage has opened.

Employees who work for business units that are scheduled to move to the new building and are currently parking in an Enron Contract garage or on the parking waitlist you are being offered a parking space in the new Enron Center garage.

This is the only offer you will receive during the initial migration to the new garage. Spaces will be filled on a first come first served basis. The cost for the new garage will be the same as Allen Center garage which is currently $165.00 per month, less the company subsidy, leaving a monthly employee cost of $94.00.

If you choose not to accept this offer at this time, you may add your name to the Enron Center garage waiting list at a later day and offers will be made as spaces become available. 

The  Sky Ring  that connects the garage and both buildings will not be opened until summer 2001. All initial parkers will have to use the street level entrance to Enron Center North until  Sky Ring access is available. Garage stairways next to the elevator lobbies at each floor may be used as an exit in the event of elevator trouble. 

If you are interested in accepting this offer, please reply via email to Parking and Transportation as soon as you reach a decision. Following your email, arrangements will be made for you to turn in your old parking card and receive a parking transponder along with a an information packet for the new garage.

The Parking and Transportation desk may be reached via email at Parking and Transportation/Corp/Enron or 713-853-7060  with any questions.

Judy, you were assigned to my U.S and Canadian  tax returns. I am a
employee of Enron North America and previously was an  employee of Enron
Canada in Calgary.

As we had discussed at the time of my filing, I was  never given any
advise
on my relocation to the U.S. regarding tax issues, As  such I am not
sure
what some of my next moves should be. I very much  require some
assistance regarding spousal employment. My wife is a  registered nurse
and
would like to work in the U.S., but I have been advised  that this may
affect my filing in the U.S. and perhaps could cost me more in  U.S.
Taxes.

Can we set up a meeting to discuss strategies on  making sure I am going
about this properly.

This is my home e-mail address, you can contact me  here or at my work
address, Barry.Tycholiz@enron.com.

Thanks in advance.

this afternoon Kris, Sarah, Gloria and I talked with Bob Detonte and Carol Consolver from SoCal.  They will provide Kris with information reconciling imbalance data.  They clarified that imbalance trading will be reflected immediately, thus lessening our exposure.  They agreed to several changes in the contract including procedures for posting of margin.  They agreed to consider our requests to increase imbalance tolerance from $2.5 million to $10 million, and to scale the requirement according to our credit rating.  We expect an answer on these latter issues later today or early tomorrow.  The first reaction was that $10 million may be a ""little too rich"".

Just got off the phone with Rick Hawley--Puget's CFO.  He was very cordial and indicated the company was interested in talking with us.  We had a fairly open discussion of who we should contact.  In the end, he suggested that we call Bill Gaines, VP Energy Supply.  He said that as CFO he is head of the Risk Management Committee and that anything that was discussed with Bill would go through his committee.  I highlighted the notion that we were interested in talking about services that could be helpful to their risk management efforts and that would be beneficial to both of our companies.  

By the way, at the beginning of the call, I made clear that we were not talking about total outsourcing.  

He didn't immediately respond, but in the context of our discussion re:  who to talk to he stated that we should talk to him if we wanted to have a more strategic discussion on outsourcing.  Then he said something to the effect of ""of course, we're not at all interested in a more comprehensive outsourcing product.""

Bill's number is 425.462.3145.  He said that we can tell Bill, Rick suggested we call him directly.  "

The enclosed spreadsheet contains data extracted from PGT's semi-annual fuel
tracker filings which might be of interest.  It is possible PGT might claim
the increasing fuel cost parts of your intervention as ""unsubstantiated"" and
therefore should be excluded and ignored by the Commission.
 <<PGTfuel.xls>>

There could well be a case for roll-in.  If there is, PGT didn't include it
in their filing.  I guess we will see how it all shakes out.  It's
interesting no-one has yet asked FERC to require a new rate case by a
specific date or to force the trivial rate reduction through to Shippers.

Estimate of marginal/incremental fuel consumption due to new capacity:

NEW CONTRACTS
210,800 dt; 612.46 mi => 	(210,800)/(1 -0.0050%*612.46)*(612.46) =
133,185,095 dt-miles/day
  20,380 dt; 612.46 mi =>	(20,380)/(1 -0.0050%*612.46)*(612.46) =
12,876,244 dt-miles/day

				annual average (5 mo winter, 7 mo summer) =
138,550,197 dt-miles/day

BASE CASE, FULL EXISTING SYSTEM
1.385 e9 dt-miles/day, useage of 68.6 Mdt/day, or 0.0050%/mile

MARGINAL FUEL PERCENTAGE ESTIMATE
0.0101 %/mile, slope of line from chart 'ex5' as computed on sheet 'regr'
Sheet 'ex8' has all the historical data points and their derivations.

Additional Fuel estimate
0.0101 %/mile * 138,550,197 dt-miles/day = 14.0 Mdt/day

Total Fuel Used
68.6 + 14.0 = 82.6 Mdt/day

Total Throughput
1.385 + 0.139 = 1.524 e9 dt-mi/day

Estimated resultant average fuel:
82.6 Mdt/day / 1.524 e9 dt-mi/day = 0.00542 %/mile.

Increase in average fuel to existing shippers
0.00542%/mile - 0.0050%/mile = 0.00042 %/mile
612.46 mi * 0.00042 %/mile = 0.257% on a Kingsgate-to-Malin path.
At $5.00 /dt, 0.257%*$5 = $0.013 /dt

Since the combined toll (cash toll plus fuel value) goes up, PGT must make a
case that roll-in is beneficial.



The previous filings by PGT that provide the historical data are:

Timely note, and once again I am already hard at work prospecting for you up here.
They are getting ready to drill CBM this fall. I've been meeting with them on this and actually set them up to do a deal with ATS on production/revenue/lease acctg in the US (next mtg Oct 9 in Calgary).  I gave them a presentation a few weeks ago on the general things we and ATS can do for them in Denver/Dallas.  I want to send them something more specific about all we can do in the Rockies on the gas mktg side.  I'll also build in some data on Hanover for them so will draw that from Producer One.
Can I get some general slides about all the good things Mark and the gang do in Denver.
Timing is next few days.  I'd like to get this to them by sometime Friday if possible (not the end of the world if it's early next week). 
Thanks.

If one of the exercises is to standardize ( as best as possible the two agreements) I think we need to create a document that identifies the variance in the agreements. Has this been done and if so, can I have a copy to review. I have gone through both the US and Canadian agreements but am not sure where some of the subtle differences lie.

Call if you want to discuss.

Tough sell for Davis as suppliers balk 
By Steve Geissinger
SACRAMENTO BUREAU 
SACRAMENTO -- With an economic ""perfect storm"" and an election looming, Gov. Gray Davis wants to renegotiate several of the state's expensive long-term power contracts -- a move that could translate into a big break for Californians. 
But the generators who signed the multibillion-dollar contracts to supply the state will be a tough sell on the notion, even though many have indicated they will at least listen to the state. 
""If the politicians were to make all these contracts go away, ... who the hell is going to meet with the state and negotiate any (new) contracts?"" asked Peter Cartwright, president of San Jose-based Calpine Corp., a major supplier of California power. 
And many experts and analysts are skeptical about Davis' chances of getting generators to substantially lower the price of power they sell to the state, which, in turn, supplies California customers through various utilities. 
""Good luck!"" former Republican Gov. Pete Wilson sarcastically declared upon hearing of the Democratic governor's plan. 
Davis, however, has suddenly thrust the idea of renegotiating some of the costly power-supply contracts to the center of a wildly complex tangle of fiscal, political and legal issues tied to the energy crisis, the ailing economy and their impact on the growing state budget deficit. 
The outcome could affect the pocketbooks of energy consumers and taxpayers alike for years, perhaps decades. 
""This could save billions of dollars,"" said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights, one of the consumer groups that has embraced Davis' power contract renegotiation plan. 
Barry Goode, Davis' legal affairs secretary, said the administration is ""not targeting every contract"" because the pacts have been ""extremely valuable in keeping the market stable."" 
The governor's aides refused to reveal which generators they will approach or the arguments they intend to use on the companies, whose contracts don't require them to reopen negotiations with the state. 
The governor signed more than 50 long-term contracts -- worth more than $40 billion -- with about two dozen generators at the height of the energy crisis earlier this year. 
The state made short-term purchases to supply California after soaring wholesale prices shattered utilities, then entered the longer-term pacts that provide about a third of the state's power demands. The contracts range in duration from a few months to 20 years. 
Though the contracts provide power at an average $69 per megawatt-hour over the next decade, the current market has dropped to less than half that rate. And the contracts provide more electricity than the state needs at times, forcing California to sell the excess at multimillion-dollar losses. 
The long-term contracts, harshly criticized by Republicans seeking the GOP gubernatorial nomination, have become a political liability for Davis as he heads into a re-election bid next year. 
The liability is compounded due to the pacts' potential role in what experts at a recent economic summit at Stanford University termed a brewing ""perfect storm"" of fiscal calamities. 
The state Public Utilities Commission, principally citing a desire for less costly power, has refused to allocate a revenue stream -- generated from recent electricity rate hikes and anticipated bond proceeds -- to finance the long-term contracts. 
The standoff has pitted Davis and Democratic state Treasurer Phil Angelides against another of the state's most powerful Democrats, Senate leader John Burton of San Francisco, who sided with the Democratic-controlled PUC. 
Burton has called ""for Californians to be freed from egregious, unreasonable and expensive provisions contained in these contracts."" 
The deadlock is holding up a $12.5 billion bond sale intended not only to help fund California's future power costs but repay state coffers for the billions of dollars spent earlier this year on emergency, short-term electricity purchases. It would be the largest municipal debt sale in U.S. history. 
Without the bond issue, a projected general fund deficit of up to $14 billion next year could grow to a staggering $20 billion-plus, forcing Draconian cuts in essential government services, according to state finance officials. 
The projected deficit of up to $14 billion in California's annual budget of about $100 billion stems from lagging tax revenue in a cooling economy, further chilled by the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the East Coast. 
Against the backdrop of fiscal woes, analysts said successful renegotiation of some long-term power contracts could conceivably wind up sparing Californians electricity rate hikes, tax increases or both. 
But some analysts are pessimistic, like Wilson. The former governor is widely blamed for legislation that triggered the energy crisis, and yet he in turn blames Davis for not acting quickly enough to head off power woes. 
The Western Power Trading Forum, a group representing suppliers and brokers, has made it clear generators will expect the state to give them something substantial in return for any changes in the pacts. Such incentives might include settling disputes over power buys or the state dropping lawsuits against suppliers. 
""We're not going to say no. We'd certainly sit down at the table with them and say, 'Let's see, maybe we can do this, maybe we can do that,'"" said Calpine's Cartwright. 
If state officials simply broke some of their contracts, not only would penalties be ""very, very severe,"" but also ""they would have completely blown their credibility, and no one would negotiate with them,"" Cartwright said. 
His comments coincided with reports that Calpine's third-quarter profits more than doubled, despite a sharp drop in short-term electricity prices in California, one of its main markets. Analysts said Calpine's performance can be largely attributed to its long-term contracts with the state. 
Heller, one of the state's most vocal consumer advocates, said Davis ""is right to look back at the environment in which these contracts were signed and demand that the power companies come to the table and renegotiate, or even throw out many of the contracts."" 
""Last spring,"" Heller said, ""power companies had a gun to the governor's head and, with staff that already had conflicts of interest, the administration signed some terrible deals."""

You would also receive the future benefit of existing tolls relative to incrementally priced expansions.Start date is open for discussion.

Below are some examples of storage services that AEC Storage & Hub Services
can provide at the AECO Storage Facilities located in Alberta.  I priced out
a profile based on our conversation this morning where you indicated that
typically Sierra Pacific usually required a greater withdrawal rate then
injection rate.  I also selected an inventory capacity of 500,000 GJ
(Approximately 0.5 BCF), although I can price out the AECO storage at
utilizing different Withdrawal/Injection rates as well as different
Capacities if you desire.

Proposal #1 (10 Month)
Contract Profile: Standard Profile where Withdrawal/Injection rates are tied
to daily inventory levels, see table below for rate details.
Term: June 2001 to March 31, 2002
Capacity: 500,000 GJ
Withdrawal Rate: 20,000 GJ/d
Injection Rate: 14,000 GJ/d
Demand Cost: CAD 49,844 per month
Commodity: CAD 0.18/GJ on injection only

Proposal #2 (34 Month)
Contract Profile: Standard Profile where Withdrawal/Injection rates are tied
to daily inventory levels, see table below for rate details.
Term: June 2001 to March 31, 2004
Capacity: 500,000 GJ
Withdrawal Rate: 20,000 GJ/d
Injection Rate: 14,000 GJ/d
Demand Cost: CAD 44,860 per month
Commodity: CAD 0.18/GJ on injection only

The following table illustrates the Withdrawal/Injection rate profiles as it
relates to inventory for Proposals #1 &#2.

	MAX	MAX
	WITHDRAWAL	INJECTION
INVENTORY	RATE	RATE
(PJ)	(TJ/D)	(TJ/D)
0.00	10.0	14.0
0.05	12.0	14.0
0.10	14.0	14.0
0.13	15.0	14.0
0.15	16.0	14.0
0.18	17.0	14.0
0.20	18.0	14.0
0.25	20.0	14.0
0.30	20.0	12.6
0.35	20.0	11.2
0.38	20.0	10.5
0.40	20.0	9.8
0.45	20.0	8.4
0.50	20.0	7.0


Proposals #3 &#4 are based on Flat profiles for Withdrawal & Injection
regardless of your Inventory position.  These proposals provide maximum
flexibility.

Proposal #3 (10 Month)
Contract Profile: Flat
Term: June 2001 to March 31, 2002
Capacity: 500,000 GJ
Withdrawal Rate: 20,000 GJ/d
Injection Rate: 14,000 GJ/d
Demand Cost: CAD 85,882 per month

Proposal #4 (34 Month)
Contract Profile: Flat
Term: June 2001 to March 31, 2004
Capacity: 500,000 GJ
Withdrawal Rate: 20,000 GJ/d
Injection Rate: 14,000 GJ/d
Demand Cost: CAD 81,182 per month
Commodity: CAD 0.18/GJ on injection only

Please review the above proposals and call me when you have had time to look
them over.  Additional please note that all the prices I quote above are
negotiable.  If you have any other profiles you would like priced please
give me a call and I'll get them priced out ASAP.

Our research had resulted in an opinion that there is little value associated with PG&E's (northern CA customers) recall rights on Block III capacity.  While it was not part of the original settlement, the 24 hour RE-recall rights to the shipper of record appear to give PG&E a DAILY call on capacity at best. 

Because we have pieced this opinion together based upon rulings in various proceedings, we would like a more formal regulatory/legal opinion of the mechanics of the RE-recall provision that has been developed over time. Is this something that either of you can provide or should it go to Randy? The results of this inquiry will set the tone of our next round of dicussions with EPNG.

 By the way, still waiting on their written reponse to our letter..... I think they have bigger fish to fry.

Howard, can you please verify what you mean by renewal rights.. specifically who owns what rights and until which period.

It is my expectation that with the exception of CNRL, ENA/ECC holds the obligation and annual renewal rights on Nova, ANG. We have assigned the PGT permanently out of Nov 08 to Calpine and Sierra Pacific.. We also have the obligation to give them the matching upstream capacity at that time.

Also, where do you think AEC, Talisman and CNRL will be to take permanent assignment of this pipe effective asap... thus changing the deal delivery point around..( an the credit situation). 

Included in the shuffle will be the liquids obligations, nominations, ( ENA /ECC can still act as the agent) but most importantly the thing we need to transfer over is the pipe obligation on PGT..... stat !!! 
 
Pls advise.

  As you know, I have been working with Steve Lins to negotiate the ISDA agreement so that Enron and the City of Glendale are able to enter into financial transactions.  I spoke with Steve today and he plans to review our latest draft and get back to me with any final changes so that we can send him an executable copy, along with our required documents, for signature next week.  In other words, I am confident that we will have an executed ISDA within the next couple of weeks.

  My boss, Barry Tycholiz, and I are going to be in southern California September 17 & 18 and would like to set up a meeting with you guys to discuss alternatives to swaping out some of your index priced gas supply.  We are available to meet with you after 2 pm on the 17th or at any time on the 18th.  Please let me know when you guys are available and I will set that time aside for you.  

We look forward to meeting with you and expanding our business with the City of Glendale.  Please feel free to call me if you have any questions.

Thanks,

By the way, at the beginning of the call, I made clear that we were not talking about total outsourcing.  

He didn't immediately respond, but in the context of our discussion re:  who to talk to he stated that we should talk to him if we wanted to have a more strategic discussion on outsourcing.  Then he said something to the effect of ""of course, we're not at all interested in a more comprehensive outsourcing product.""

I see how you are doing this.  You are using some early estimates of fuel I
gave you.  You know you should not trust me.  We have some better numbers
now.  It turns out that our average fuel usage rate for calendar 2000 was
.0044 % per pipeline mile.  Stretching this out over 612 miles, KG to Malin
yields a rate of 2.69%.  This is just one place to start when examining the
impact of the expansion.  The modeling of the expansion yields an
incremental rate for the 200,000 mcfd of 7.46%.  If you combine those on a
weighted average you will get 3.24%.  The quantities at KG are significantly
higher than in your estimate.  Regardless, these are the numbers we are
currently predicting.  The actuals will be different and perhaps lower as
the operators optimize the system performance.  Who knows.  Also we are
predicting that the pipeline looping will be constructed in advance and put
into service ahead of the compression.  So on a long term basis (like the
first year) the fuel rate will decrease due to the  looping.

I had promised that I would send my fuel calculation over! Please check on
this:

Current fuel (king to malin) = 2,200,000 mmbtu/d*.03 = 66,000 mmbtu

Proposed fuel = 2,400,000 mmbtu/d*.036 = 86,400 mmbtu

Difference = 20,400/200,000 incremental capacity = 10.2%

Please advise!!

It comes in direct response to recent announcements of expansions into California by pipelines.
The bid protocols will be structured similar to original open season from the original Gas Accord.
The open season will start on June 1 and end on July 31.
Capacity will be available starting 1.1.03.
Bidders will be able to bid up to 30 years (PG&E states that that's what generators want).
Accompanying the announcement will be another announcement that PG&E will expand Redwood by 200mmcf/day, which they hope to have available by 1.1.03, or some time during Q103.
About 2-4 weeks after the open season begins, PG&E will file its proposed ""Gas Accord II,""  (the first one expires end of 02).
As part of that filing, PG&E will offer its proposed ratemaking treatment for the next five years (beginning 1.1.03).
PG&E will not include in the open season 1) core capacity and 2) certain EAD contracts that extend beyond the Gas Accord 1 end date.
In addition, PG&E will hold back an additional 20% (after excluding core and EAD), to be ""open-seasoned"" at some ""future"" date.
The capacity to be auctioned is: 1) 900 mmcf/day on Redwood, 2) 245 (annual) on Baja, plus an additional 200/day in summer on Baja, 3) 155 on Silverado.
How PG&E will market the 20% they intend to hold back, and when they might auction it off in the future will be discussed in PG&E's Gas Accord II filing.
No single company will be awarded more than 30% of the capacity on any specific path in the primary open season (though firms can bid whatever level of capacity they choose).

Please forwad along to anyone else who might be interested.  If you have any questions, just holler.

Best,
Jeff"

INTEROFFICE MEMO

To: All of ENA and EES

Re: ENA and EES Industrial SIC Codes

As Enron continues to build its origination and customer business in the US, it is becoming increasingly important that both ENA and EES target the appropriate industries and customers with our respective value propositions.  Double coverage and duplication waste resources and damages Enron's reputation in the market place.  It is also important that the right product, solution and sales technique are utilized to ensure the maximum benefit for our customers and Enron.

Consistent with the past, EES will be focused on those SIC codes or industries that are less energy intensive and are less sophisticated in their management of energy.  ENA shall continue to target and cover those industries and customers that are very energy intensive and employ significant process load.  We ask that both organizations respect the boundary.  In those few cases where this policy is not appropriate, please over communicate to ensure close coordination between ENA and EES before customer contact. 

Effective immediately in the US and regardless of total energy consumption or number of sites, the following SIC codes have coverage responsibility in ENA.  All other industrial and commercial SIC codes and activity will be managed by EES.

ENA SIC Codes:

Primary Metals Mining and Extraction 
Oil and Gas Extraction
Paper and Forest Products
Chemicals - except for pharmaceutical, biotech and small specialty chemical that will be EES customers
Refining
Petroleum and Coal Manufacturing
Plastics and Rubber Manufacturing
Fertilizer
Rail
Auto - restricted to the Big Three - Ford, GM and Daimler-Chrysler
Cement
Aerospace - restricted to Boeing, Raytheon, GE Aircraft, Allied Signal, Hamilton-Sundstrom

First thing he has to do is convince Davis' lawyers that his companies' client list (which includes TW) shouldn't conflict him out of working on DWR gas deals.
He should have that figured out by this week--sounds like he may have to make some decisions about his current client list and working for DWR.
I told him that we'd like to sit down as soon as possible to discuss opportunities for us to help out DWR with its gas needs.
He said that he'd be happy to do that, once he's got all conflict issues worked out with the Governor's office.
He's going to get back to me to set up a meeting; and if I don't hear from him by Monday/Tuesday of next week, I'll call him back to set up a meeting.
I'm assuming that you'd be part of that meeting?
I asked him what sort of deals they're working on. As you likely know, some of the contracts permit DWR to either 1) provide gas to the plant providing DWR power under the power contract or 2) manage the plant's fuel supply.  So they're looking to get ""soup-to-nuts"" supply service for those contracts that include a fuel-supply option.

Subject:	El Paso's Bid to Hike Export Capacity Opposed 

NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
published : September 20, 2001
El Paso's Bid to Hike Export Capacity Opposed 
Southwest local distribution utilities and municipal distributors have called on FERC to reject, or convene a technical conference to consider, El Paso Natural Gas' application to boost export capacity on the Samalayuca Lateral by about 100 MMcf/d to meet natural gas demand in northern Mexico. They argue that such action would deprive existing El Paso customers of already-tight capacity on the pipeline's South Mainline. 
There are a number of ongoing cases at the Commission addressing the limited capacity on the El Paso system, and its capacity-allocation procedures, the distributors pointed out. ""Yet...El Paso proposes to allow a unilateral reallocation of 100,000 Mcf./d of capacity to serve customers outside the United States without fully disclosing from which customer the capacity will come and its likely impact on all these pending matters,"" said Southern Union Gas Co. The utility asked the Commission to convene a technical conference. 
Southwest Gas Corp. and the El Paso Municipal Customer Group said they were concerned the proposed increase in the lateral's capacity may ""adversely affect"" them and other customers because capacity on the South Mainline would be needed to move the additional export load. FERC ""should not approve increased export capacity without a corresponding increase in mainline capacity"" on El Paso's system, they said. 
Southwest and the municipal distributors urged the Commission to either: 1) reject the El Paso application outright; 2) in the alternative, set the case for hearing to assess the impact on existing customers; or 3) absent rejection or hearing, defer consideration of the application until other pending cases related to the level of capacity on El Paso are resolved. 
In its application, El Paso asked FERC for the go-ahead to increase the maximum daily export capacity on the lateral by about one-third to 308 MMcf/d to correspond with the ""rapid development"" of the gas infrastructure in the northern Mexico state of Chihuahua. It said it already had entered into a long-term agreement for the entire proposed increase of 100 MMcf/d of export capacity with MGI Supply Ltd (See Daily GPI, Aug. 31 <d20010831e.html>). "

Subject:	One Way vs. Two Way Payments

I have reviewed the master physical gas agreements for the 10 counterparties (excluding trading companies) at the top of the exposure list to determine whether the contracts contemplate one-way or two-way payments.

1.  Petro Canada Oil & Gas - One Way
2.  Canadian Natural Resources - Two Way
3.  Marathon Canada Limited - One Way
4.  Husky Oil Operations Limited - One Way
5.  Murphy Canada Exploration Company - One Way
6.  Encal Energy Ltd. - One Way
7.  Talisman Energy Inc. - One Way
8.  Premstar Energy Canada Ltd. - Two Way
9.  Rio Alto Exploration Ltd. - One Way
10.  Sunoco Inc. - Two Way

The basic operation of a one way payment provision is that, if the defaulting party has a net in-the-money position based upon the Early Termination Damages calculation, the Early Termination Damages are deemed to be zero and the non-defaulting party is not required to pay that amount to the defaulting party (the defaulting party's position is wiped out).  However, we would still be entitled, prior to default, to call for collateral where a counterparty's out-of-the money position is in excess of its collateral threshold, which would provide us with security to ensure the counterparty continues to pay.  In addition, if the counterparty failed to post such collateral, they would be in default, we could terminate the contract and, as the non-defaulting party, we would be in a position to realize on our in-the-money position.  If, after we received the collateral, we were then to become insolvent or otherwise default under the master, the counterparty could terminate the contract, our mark-to-market position would be wiped out and we would be required to return any unused collateral.

The operation of a two way payment provision is that the early termination damages are calculated by the non-defaulting party and whoever has a net in-the-money position based upon such calculation is owed the termination payment, regardless of whether such party is the defaulting or non-defaulting party.  In other words, unlike a one way payment, if the defaulting party has a net in-the-money position upon termination of the contract, the non-defaulting party will be required to pay that amount to the defaulting party.  Therefore, if we were to become insolvent or otherwise default under a master and we had a net in-the-money position under that master, the counterparty could terminate the contract but we would still be owed our mark-to-market position.  The other point to consider in the situation where there is a two way payment provision is that, of the three counterparty masters above that contain two way payments, all three also contain cherry picking language that, upon the occurrence of an event of default other than insolvency, allows the non-defaulting counterparty to pick and choose which transactions to terminate.  In other words, the counterparty need not terminate all transactions, which could effect the amount otherwise owed to the defaulting party.  Even with cherry-picking, upon the occurrence of an insolvency, all transactions are deemed to terminate, so cherry picking would not be a factor.

You had also asked whether the failure by a party to call for collateral when it is entitled to under a contract would have an impact on the ability of such party to collect on a termination payment owed to it upon termination of the contract.  Other than the fact that the failure to call for collateral may mean that we do not hold credit support that would be usable to offset a termination payment owing if the party obligated to pay fails to pay, the right to call for collateral is just that, a right and not an obligation, and the failure to call for collateral does not colour the right of the party owed the termination payment to require it be paid.

Let me know if you need anything further with respect to this matter.

I'm very interested.  Can you put together a proposal?
Brian

>>> <Mark.Whitt@enron.com> 06/08/01 10:27AM >>>

I have been working on the San Juan deal we discussed.  The expansions
don't look very good.  Sonora Pipeline which is the Kinder
Morgan/Calpine
project is doubtful.  The rates on it look pretty good ($.39) but that
is
because they need subscriptions of  750 MM/d for 20 years.  It doesn't
seem
to feasible right now and they don't seem very confident in their
ability
to get it done.  The Transwestern expansion is only out of the Permian
basin so it won't fit and we believe that El Paso will be the same
although
that has yet to be determined.  However, it seems unlikely  that El
Paso
will expand out of the San Juan becuase their load growth is primarily
on
the south leg.

That is the bad news!  The good news is that we have existing space
that we
acquired on El Paso that began in June and continues through May of
2006.
Since the spreads have come in it is probably priced pretty well and I
believe we would give it to you at market.  We could structure it like
our
Wyoming deal in that we would manage the capacity and California
Border
sales for you.  I believe the space we have goes to PG&E.  The other
good
point is that you could control the ROFR in 2006.

Let me know if this is something you are interested in and I will work
up a
proposal for you.

Thanks

Mark

What I would like is to come up with a coherent message on hedging in CA, particularly the core-non-core issues, so that at the end of the day, EES still has a market and ENA can sell hedges to the LDCs.  Sue Landwehr in Gov Affairs is the leader/coordinator of our hedging activities before the state commissions and we should get her involved as well.  In fact I will cc both Sue and Jeff on this.

Subject:	CA Instrate Gas matters

This is to quickly summarize our call on July 11 on California gas intrastate matters and set a direction for future activity.

Unbundling:	 PG&E has a Gas Accord in effect through 12/31/03, which is generally positive.  We will participate in the development of a successor plan, and attempt to improve it if we can.
  		SoCalGas attempted its own version of a gas accord, but the CPUC refused to approve.  We will attempt to resurrect this accord and obtain CPUC approval. 

Hedging:  No proceeding currently exists to address gas hedging by LDCs.  (draft legislation does exist on the electric side to allow hedging and passthrough of costs).  Jeff has recommended that we approach the LDCs to begin discussing the issue and developing a strategy to take to the CPUC.  I suggest we develop an ENA-EES hedging proposal for CA and then take that to the LDCs.  I will attempt to put this is writing.

Infrastructure:  CPUC has undertaken a proceeding to determine the need to improve infrastructure.  SoCal Gas and PG&E are responding with proposals.  We want to revitalize the infrastructure and ensure real markets exist and can develop.  Our task is to participate in these proceedings.

(Please let me know who I left off the mailing list)."

As a follow up to yesterday's meeting, below is a summary of the course of action to be taken in response to Citizens comments on the service agreement with EAMR.

Enron will work with Citizens to put an insurance policy in place, which meets the insurance provisions requested by Citizens and which names both Citizens and EAMR as policy holders.  See attached file for proposed policy details.
The cost for this policy (not to be revealed to Citizens) will be between $5,000 and $7,500 and will be paid for by ENA.
ENA will enter into a side letter agreement with EAMR, which will provide for the insurance premium payment.
Upon agreement with Citizens on the insurance policy details, EAMR is agreeable to executing a services agreement with Citizens, however, Citizens must agree to EAMR's indemnity and liability contract language as written in its original draft (see attached below). 


Attached is a file containing Citizens' comments on its draft services agreement with EAMR.  Article 8 of the draft agreement details the insurance provisions requested by Citizens.

PG&E restructuring bid draws state ire 
By Dale Kasler and Carrie Peyton
Bee Staff Writers 
(Published Sept. 21, 2001)

In a controversial attempt to dig its way out of bankruptcy, Pacific Gas and Electric Co. proposed a radical restructuring Thursday that would pay off its debts but end state regulation of the utility's valuable hydroelectric and nuclear plants. 
To make the plan work, PG&E asked a U.S. bankruptcy judge to override state laws and regulations governing power-plant ownership -- a request that triggered immediate opposition from California officials. 
PG&E said the plan, a complicated blend of asset transfers, debt refinancing and corporate spinoffs, would restore the utility's financial health and creditworthiness without requiring additional rate hikes or a state ""bailout."" Divorcing the utility from its parent company, the plan would pay off the entire $13.2 billion of debt PG&E accumulated during California's poorly executed era of deregulation. 
The plan, filed in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in San Francisco, had the support of a key block of creditors, including independent energy generators, whose approval is necessary to any reorganization plan. 
But it ran into immediate opposition from Gov. Gray Davis and other state officials, setting up a potentially fierce battle. Despite PG&E's claims to the contrary, they warned the plan could trigger more hikes because PG&E could charge nearly double the amount it currently charges for electricity from the hydro and nuclear plants. The proposal would have the state Public Utilities Commission relinquish control over those plants to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
FERC ""has proven over the last 18 months to be ... no friend of the ratepayer,"" Davis told reporters Thursday. ""The PUC, while far from perfect, has been a stronger advocate for ratepayers than the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. ... I'm very wary of PG&E's proposal to transfer all of its generating capacity from a regulated environment to a non-regulated environment."" 
The PUC vowed to fight the plan in court. ""I don't think the judge is going to do it,"" said PUC President Loretta Lynch. 
Consumer advocates noted that PG&E has been pushing for years to end state regulation of its hydro plants. ""It's complete piracy,"" said Nettie Hoge, head of The Utility Reform Network of San Francisco. ""It's the most audacious thing I've ever seen."" 
Filed six months after the utility sought bankruptcy protection, the plan calls for PG&E to be spun off from PG&E Corp., but the utility would transfer its hydro and nuclear plants and some other assets to the parent. 
That would violate a state law, passed as a response to the energy crisis, prohibiting utilities from selling any of their generating plants before 2006. The law was intended to keep electricity in California hands at a time when out-of-state generators were charging ultra-high prices to PG&E and Southern California Edison. 
PG&E acknowledged the conflict with state law but said it will ask the bankruptcy court -- a federal entity -- to override the state law. Legal experts said it's not clear whether a bankruptcy judge would ignore state law, and in prior rulings U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Dennis Montali has sided with state officials. 
""Any federal court would be very reluctant to go in and override state laws,"" said influential state Sen. Debra Bowen, D-Marina del Rey, chair of the Senate Energy Committee. 
Robert D. Glynn Jr., PG&E's chairman, called the transfer a good deal for customers. He said the electricity from those plants would be sold back to the utility at about $50 a megawatt hour -- ""the lower end"" of current rates -- under a 12-year contract. 
But that's almost double the existing rates for those plants, critics said. 
And Gary Cohen, the PUC's general counsel, said the company would be free to charge market rates when the contract runs out, putting utility customers at the mercy of an independent, unregulated generator. 
""This is more of what got us into this mess to begin with,"" Cohen said. 
Despite the friction between PG&E and the state, the plan requires assurance from the PUC that the utility will be allowed to collect its wholesale power costs in the future from ratepayers, regardless of how high they go. Such assurance will make the utility creditworthy again and able to borrow money to fund the reorganization, PG&E said. 
The plan also requires approval from federal officials and a ""yes"" vote from a majority of PG&E's creditors, along with Montali. 
Glynn said the plan could be completed by December 2002, enabling the utility to resume buying electricity. The state has been buying power for PG&E since January, when it became insolvent. 
While the PUC raised rates an average of 40 percent this year, the reorganization plan doesn't require another rate hike, Glynn insisted. ""From the customers' view, this transaction will be seamless,"" he said. The same should be true for most employees, he said. 
The PG&E chairman, whose company has feuded with Davis for months, also boasted that PG&E isn't ""asking the state for a bailout or a rescue"" -- a jab at Davis' as-yet-unsuccessful effort to sell the Legislature on a multibillion-dollar rescue for Edison. 
It's unclear what impact PG&E's proposal would have on Edison's attempt to avoid bankruptcy. Edison's creditors, already angered that the Legislature adjourned without passing the Davis-backed plan, might conclude that Edison is better off in bankruptcy and could push the Southern California utility into court, analysts said. 
The PG&E proposal involves a complicated series of property transfers and bond offerings that would leave the current PG&E Corp. split into two separate, publicly-traded companies. 
The utility company, Pacific Gas and Electric, would become strictly a retailer and would sell other assets -- including its hydro and nuclear plants, transmission wires and gas pipelines -- to PG&E Corp. for $4.06 billion in cash and IOUs. PG&E Corp. shareholders would receive stock in the slimmed-down utility, although the details of the stock transaction haven't been worked out. 
The bankruptcy proposal represents the fourth time in three years that PG&E has tried to remove its hydro plants from state control. The PUC and Legislature have resisted because of potential impacts on costs and the environment. 
Despite the criticism, PG&E said removing those assets from regulators' oversight is essential to making the plan work. Why? Because PUC rules limit how much money the utility can borrow against those assets, said utility spokesman Ron Low. If the assets became property of PG&E Corp., the corporation could borrow a lot more money and use the proceeds to pay its debts. Glynn said he's had ""in-depth discussions"" with investment bankers about issuing new bonds. 
Also, by removing the generating plants from PUC oversight, the plan can produce more cash for debt repayment, said credit analyst David Bodek of Standard & Poor's Corp. in New York. 
If state officials fight the plan, ""the question arises, 'How do you discharge these (debts)?' "" Bodek said. ""Here's a plan that does that."" 
The plan would pay creditors $9.1 billion in cash and $4.1 billion in bonds. Creditors with debts of more than $100,000 would get 60 percent in cash and 40 percent in bonds, which will be paid in 10 or more years, said Paul Aronzon, attorney for a committee of unsecured creditors. 
""There's some credibility here, and it works,"" Aronzon said of the plan. 
Gary Ackerman, a spokesman for independent generators, said his group would probably accept the plan, even if it means they have to wait years to get some of their money. 
Shareholders also endorsed the plan. PG&E Corp.'s stock jumped $1.22, to $15.72, on a day when the markets took another bad fall"

project.

We continue to work on numbers and have had other co's contact us for a
quote.

At this time, do you know if TransAlta is going to pursue submitting a
response to this project?  Do you still require numbers from us?

If so, then I need to coordinate with the appropriate desks pricing and
ENA's response to you and other co's!! ( if any)

Drop me a note as soon as possible and I will go from there. Thanks. BT

Rate case settlements reached between a pipeline, its customers and Commission Staff sometime prescribes the treatment of gains on the sale of assets and specifically the sale of base gas volumes (eg Columbia, CNG settlements).  In review of the past two rate case settlements of Williston Basin (WBI) I found no such provisions.  In its current rate case proceeding before FERC a limited settlement was reached which dealt primarily with net plant and labor costs.  A hearing was held on all remaining issues and is currently in the briefing stage.  Neither in the limited settlement, nor in the hearing was disposition of base gas revenues addressed.

However, the reorganizational settlement that conveyed facilities from MDU to WBI may be a factor.  As a result of restructuring under 636 WBI was obligated to sell certain excess volumes of company owned working gas (priced at $.47 /mcf) to its customers.  WBI proposed to sell the gas at market and retain any profits.  As mentioned in the LeBeoeuf, Lamb memo the Commission addressed this issues several times, reversing itself in the process, and finally ordered that WBI must sell the working gas at cost.  Though not relying entirely on the reorganizational settlement, throughout the various orders, the Commission referenced the 1985 reorganizational settlement as requiring any gains on the sale of working gas to be flowed through to WBI customers.  WBI sought rehearing, arguing that the Commission was taking a very broad interpretation of the settlement.  The Commission raised the issue again in its order on rehearing, among other things, and WBI didn't seek rehearing or pursue that particular argument further, which the Commission points out in its final order.

As LeBeoeuf Lamb asserts, the environment (Order 636 restructuring) in which the Commission ordered flow-through of profits on the sale of storage volumes has changed and those arguments may not be applicable anymore.  But, the reorganizational settlement might be something to take into account and should be discussed with WBI.  Just something to be aware of.

If you have any questions please call.

We have had many inquiries regarding our transportation agreements, specifically PGT, Kern River and El Paso.  

Most pressing is PGT's request to market capacity on our behalf. Although I do not believe we need to have PGT perform this function, I do believe we could mitigate some demand charge exposure for ""the estate"".  

Are you available to meet with Barry and I first thing tomorrow morning? We need to have an answer for PGT's request. We need to know what the contractual rights are for 1) the pipeline when a shipper declares bankruptcy and 2) our ability to mitigate demand charge exposure by releasing capacity on a short term basis (month at a time?).

Better yet, can we unilaterally turn capacity back to any of these pipes or do we need to reach some type of court approved settlement?

Obviously, we have many questions. Please advise of your ability to meet ASAP.

Thanks,

Stephanie

Well I appreciate the feedback.... I feel both Roger and Jeff liked and
understood the concept, but were concerned we ""controlled"" the number.   I
liken it to checking in the paper as to what the Prime interest rate is
prior to negotiating a home loan.  Once you know the relative interest
rate, you talk to a few mortgage bankers regarding points, services, etc.
and then move forward.  I would hope this is what L-P would do and
naturally I'd hope they would move forward with us.  John

Yes.  See attached.  Note that even the Commission decision overturning the ALJ's rejection of roll-in dates back to early 1999.  The 1999 Policy Statement was not issued until September 1999. 


     Procedural History

          This proceeding arises from two general section 4 rate cases
     filed by Transco in Docket Nos. RP95-197-000 and RP97-71-000. 
     Those cases have a long and complicated history which need not be
     repeated here.4/  A controversial issue in these proceedings has
     been whether the costs of Transco's twelve incrementally-priced
     Leidy and Southern expansion projects should be rolled into
     Transco's system-wide rates.   

           On April 16, 1999, the Commission issued an order5/
     reversing the ALJ's rejection of Transco's proposal to roll in
     the costs of the twelve projects.  The Commission held that, in
     determining whether Transco and the proponents of rolled-in rates
     had met their section 4 burden, the Commission would apply its
     1995 Pricing Policy Statement, 6/ which was issued one year after
     the last of the projects at issue here was certificated and
     built.  The Commission concluded that Transco had satisfied the
     conditions in the 1995 Pricing Policy Statement for rolling in
     expansion costs.

Stephanie:  Confirming our phone conversation today, based on my reading of the Transco order and the PGT order, the FERC relied on a different standard in the Transco case (the 1995 Pricing Policy Statement) than they used in the PGT case (the 1999 Policy Statement on Certification of New Interstate Natural Gas Pipeline Facilities).  

The 1995 Policy Statement said that, when the roll-in increased rates to existing shippers by less than 5%, the pipeline needed to make only a general showing of system benefits, and FERC said that Transco had satisfied that showing.  

The 1999 Policy Statement, however, has a threshold requirement for expansion projects requiring that there can be no subsidization from existing customers - in other words, no increase in costs of any kind.  The PGT order found that there was a possibility that fuel costs could increase for existing shippers; therefore, PGT had to establish a surcharge mechanism to subject expansion shippers to an incremental fuel charge for fuel costs above those that would apply absent the new compression.  If the fuel costs do not increase, then there will be no surcharge.

Greetings Becky:

Met with PGT the other day. Based upon a recent FERC ruling on the treatment of fuel on a project on Transco's Leidy Lateral (last 2 weeks), PGT is going to ask FERC to reverse its ruling on the 2002 expansion. If you remember, FERC was very clear on the notion that existing shippers should not subsidize increased costs associated with incremental shippers. I've been told that Transco received approval for rolled in treatment of higher fuel because they did not have an ""incremental"" tariff.  

This sounds very suspicious - can you please investigate?

Thanks,

Calif PUC To Pass Power-Bond Measures By Jan -Counsel

Nov. 1, 2001
LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- California utility regulators expect to approve a measure in January that will allow the state to sell $12.5 billion in bonds to repay the state's general fund and banks for power purchases made this year. 


Delays in the bond issue, originally planned for May, may deepen the state's budget deficit in the coming fiscal year and threaten to further tarnish the state's credit ratings. 


""At this point, we are aiming to have everything done by January related to the revenue bond sale,"" said Gary Cohen, general counsel for the California Public Utilities Commission. 


The PUC refused earlier this month to pass a so-called rate agreement, which would spell out how the bonds would be repaid, because it would give the the state's power buying arm carte blanche to raise electricity rates without public hearings and without oversight by the PUC. 


In addition, PUC President Loretta Lynch wants the governor's office to renegotiate the tens of billions of dollars in long-term power contracts it signed with more than a dozen energy companies at the peak of the market. One of the commission's objections to the rate agreement is that it would lock the state into overpriced, overlong deals that will saddle ratepayers with high electricity costs for the next decade. 


So far, neither the state nor the PUC have identified which power pacts they want to renegotiate. Spokesman for Dynegy Inc. (DYN), Williams Cos. (WMB) Calpine Corp. (CPN) and Sempra Energy Resources, a unit of Sempra Energy (SRE), have said they haven't been formally contacted by state officials to talk about renegotiating the deals. 


Williams and Dynegy said they would consider renegotiating the contracts, but only if the result would benefit both parties. Calpine said it would be difficult to rewrite the pacts, but the company is willing to talk with state officials. 


The PUC met with members of Gov. Gray Davis' staff last week to figure out a strategy for renegotiating the contracts, and talks are ongoing, Cohen said. 


""We are all in agreement that we want to renegotiate at least some of the contracts,"" Cohen said. ""We have technical people looking at the contracts to figure out what we want to accomplish, what kind of portfolio we want in terms of duration and price. My view is we need to have a solid plan before we embark on renegotiations."" 


Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for Davis, said the governor's office had no comment on the renegotiation talks. "

originally configured for the NBA then we added some hockey teams to our
contract. There are 12 international first class seats and a table with
four chairs in the front cabin, the middle has 2 tables with 4 chairs and
an additional 4 world business class seats, then the back has 24 domestic
first class seats and a sofa. They are old 727's that were reconfigured.
Obviously, the NBA players sit in the front cabin since that was the idea
of the 12 seats, and coaches in the middle with tables to work,  but the
hockey players sit in the middle and back with coaches and staff occupying
the front or middle. Each Hockey teams seating is different depending on
the teams preference. Just to have a private flight makes the hockey guys
happy. Most of them still remember when they had to fly commercial. They
are not too picky. And with the steller service we provide, they don't even
notice the decor!!!

Off to bang that little white ball around grass, sand and trees!

Subject:	RE: Northwest Pipeline Discussions: LNG Terminal


Dear Colleagues:

Yesterday, Jeff Slaughter of ENA, Kyu-bong Lee and myself met with Northwest Natural Gas'  Nick Potts, Director - Gas Storage Operations, Charles Stinson, General Manager - Engineering Services & Storage, and Randy Friedman, Manager - Gas Supply.

Full report on the meeting is attached, here is a summary of the main points:

They do not object to the development of an LNG terminal by Enron on the Columbia river or to Enron's efforts to negotiate a land lease option at Port Westward.  Their pipeline system is not set up to take advantage of the regasified LNG to supply their core customers in Portland but they would consider buying directly from us for customers in the Port Westward, St. Helens, Longview area if the price was right, i.e., the lower of Sumas and Stanfield price MINUS some discount from the NW Pipeline postage stamp tariff.
They perceive some risk in relying on an LNG supply with price formula linked to Nymex that would not provide a floor for the LNG producer.
They would like to see the LNG terminal in southern Oregon, where the NW pipeline system telescopes down to 10 inches, but realize that the terminal would be lost somewhere around Coos Bay with over 150 miles to go to connect with the PGT line across the Coastal Range and the Cascades, through an area of strong environmental concerns.
At this point, the best option for Enron seems to be (pending positive report on navigational issues on the Columbia from Golder): 
a terminal close to the N/W Pipeline in the Port Westward/Longview area
selling gas directly to local customers (i.e., bypassing NW P/L transportation charges)
selling rest of gas on NW P//L
Eventually, we will need to talk to the Kelso Beaver (KB) Pipeline which operates the small diameter line to Port Westward.

Please give me a call if you have any questions.

Best,

Z

Natural Gas Futures and Cash Tumble 

    Natural gas futures for September delivery on the NYMEX tumbled $0.162 to $2.544 per MMBtu yesterday, after hitting a 18-month low on weak overall fundamentals. The October contract dropped $0.154 to $2.582 per MMBtu. The September contract traded at its lowest price since February 2000 when it reached a low of $2.53. Bearish fundamentals are triggered by last week's revised storage, mild weather and no tropical storm action on the immediate horizon. Last week, the AGA revised the prior week's reported data up 47 Bcf in addition to the higher than expect injection for the that week. The falloff is in preparation for this week's expected much higher than normal.  Most of New England and interior New York state will experience mild weather this as will most of the Pacific coast. Temperatures will turn mild in the Midwest, northern Plains and Northeast later this week, putting more pressure on the market. Look for prices to open lower this morning and continue under pressure. September options expire today and futures tomorrow. Look for next support at $2.43 and then $2.39; with resistance seen at $2.83, and then $2.97. Natural gas for next day delivery across the US and Canada was generally $0.15 to $0.20 lower yesterday, except out West where spot prices dipped about $0.05. Natural gas for next day delivery at the Henry hub lost $0.17 to $2.60 per MMBtu.

Blast Hits Canadian Natural Gas Storage Facility

     A Canadian natural gas storage facility exploded Sunday, sending a huge fireball into the sky over Fort Saskatchewan, Alberta.  The explosion happened at a BP Canada Energy pipeline processing plant when natural gas from a malfunctioning wellhead ignited. There were no reported injuries. The fire was located in an underground storage facility and is being allowed to burn itself out as it is too hot for firefighters to get close.

AGL Lowers Guidance for 2001

    AGL Resources has revised downward its fiscal 2001 earnings guidance due to overstatement of revenue and net income by SouthStar Energy Services. AGL says it will earn between $1.49 and $1.51 per share in fiscal 2001, below Wall Street estimates of $1.55 per share. AGL, Dynegy and Piedmont Natural Gas have interests in SouthStar. AGL claims SouthStar's management has overstated net income and revenues since 1998 by about $27 million. Of which AGL's portion is about $14 million. Last month, AGL filed a complaint on behalf of SouthStar to have Dynegy Marketing and Trade provide a full account of its activities as asset manager for SouthStar. AGL owns 50% of SouthStar; Piedmont, 30%; and Dynegy Marketing and Trade, 20%.

JP Morgan Cuts Forest and Louis Dreyfus Ratings

     JP Morgan has cut its ratings on Forest Oil and Louis Dreyfus Natural Gas to 'market performer' from 'long-term buy', citing lower forecasts for natural gas prices. The downgrades came after JP Morgan revised its 3rd quarter Henry Hub natural price forecast to $2.90 per MMBtu from $3.25 per MMBtu. It also dropped its 4th quarter forecast to $2.75 MMBtu from $3.75 per MMBtu. Other than lower expected natural gas prices, JP Morgan had nothing but good things to say about both companies, calling Louis Dreyfus as a well-run company with attractive assets, and noting that Forest offers attractive exploration upside potential relative to peers and appears to be set for a strong year in terms of reserve additions after recent drilling success in the Cook Inlet of Alaska.

DOE Project to Help Nuclear Power Plant Construction

  The DOE has unveiled a pilot project which will encourage private companies to consider new nuclear power plant sites. The DOE wants private companies to submit early requests to have potential sites licensed with the NRC, and has dedicated  $700,000 to subsidize site permitting studies. The plan is to help break down barriers affecting future near-term deployment of new nuclear power plants. The DOE program will look at existing sites, green-field sites and federal sites. Applications for the program are due by October 15th.

Enron Wind May Be Overvalued

    Enron is reportedly having problems in a effort to sell Enron Wind, with top prospective buyers saying the company is too expensive and there is no need to consolidate. The world's largest supplier of wind turbines with a third of the global market, Danish Vestas Wind Systems, says their strategy is grow on their own as the market grows, and will not even consider buying Enron Wind. The global wind power market is predicted to increase by an annual average rate of 19% per year over the next ten years. Enron Wind has unofficially been up for sale for several years, but has not received any reported serious interest near the asking price. German-Danish Nordex is actively seeking potential acquisition candidates and was talking to Enron Wind, but says it is too highly valued. Last week, Enron's wind turbine unit was valued at $725 million. NEG Micon, with a market share more than twice as large as Enron Wind, is worth $860 million based its stock price.

New California Energy Board at Odds with FERC

    In its first meeting, the California Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority was told that plans to build additional natural gas storage fields will provide the state with insurance against sudden price hikes resulting from supply shortages. California's governor has given the authority for up to $5 billion to build more power plants, add natural gas storage, increase renewable energy, and create conservation incentives. However, there are concerns that the agency will dampen enthusiasm for private investment in the state's beleaguered power system. In order to control their own destiny, officials say that California needs a sufficient surplus of natural gas to ensure competition. Mirroring its accusations against power generators, California has alleged that natural gas pipeline companies created non-existent shortages to drive up prices. However, the mandate given to the authority by the governor could put the state on a collision course with the FERC, which claims exclusive jurisdiction under the Federal Power Act. The authority will expire in 2006, unless the state legislature revives it.

Did Enron provide you with approval for a ""Post Arrival Consultation""/PAC?
This is the counselling our PwC Houston office does.  (So, in effect there
are two possible counselling sessions for assignees - the predeparture
counselling you are supposed to receive before you depart Canada and then
there's the PAC).  PwC Houston is prepared to set up the ""PAC"" - they
simply want to know if you received approval for it.

     have some bonds as well, that what makes them a balanced fund. Also, 
     do want us to manage the money Jacy has, or do you want to leave it 
     with him? No problem either way, just let me know.

I wasn't worried for a second.
     
I would like to have these funds in a portfolio that has a better 
performance than money markets. I already have a decent amount of money 
( 60K) in the Rice portfolio thru andrew agencies in Virden. You may 
want to look at exactly what that is, contact Jacy Whyte at Andrew 
Agencies... he will get you the details for Kim and I. 
     
Was there a particular index fund you had in mind? What do you mean by 
balanced ? Once we put it there I don't plan on touching or managing 
this until I return to Canada.  
     
Thanks, talk to you soon.

     Barry:
     
     You probably thought I had forgotten about you! I had not. I wanted
to 
     iron out some areas of concern from my end here. As you know, I am
not 
     supposed to do an investment for you while you are a resident of
the 
     US. I have discovered that if we put the money into an account and
not 
     make moves on it until you move back to Canada, then we can do it
if I 
     use a Canadian address. I was advised to put the money into a
balanced 
     fund and leave it there for now. My thoughts are to move it to a 
     couple of funds in a self administered account and NOT make any
moves 
     with it. 
     
     Please review this note, and let me know what you think. If all is
ok 
     I will mail you the forms to sign (which you signed here), and we
will 
     get this moving.
     
     Hope all is well with you down there.

- I feel like foghorn leghorn on this project (ie: ""I'm pitching but not one's catching"")...I have been trying to find ABC/ANG capacity (per your inquiry for 10,000 capacity for winter only) in addition to looking for 5,000 of ABC only capacity for Petrobank (they actually have firm ANG/PGT but let their ABC go) 
- fyi, (this has not been press released) but it looks like NOVA/ANG will have an additional 60,000 of contracted capacity avail this Nov 1 (part of the expansion that was to go with the PGT expansion but is being done early as it only goes as far as kinsgate)...no surprise that the shipper to get the capacity is BC Gas (to use for Southern Crossing) 
- I'm afraid that the best we can offer is IT Tolls (.17 C/GJ for Nova + .08 C/GJ for ANG + .06 for Fuel on ANG) = .31 C/GJ
- as far as ABC capacity, there are mismatches (that are complicated by higher fuel rates in the winter) but I will keep working the phones
- do you know if any of the PNW/Calif shippers-utilities have excess ABC capacity and an interest in ANG/PGT??? (Petrobank will likely look at any term winter/1 yr/longer)
- based on previous dealings, Petrobank is motivated

Jessica, it appears that we pay a monthly fee of $ 89.99 / mth plus monthly optional charges and all long distance and local charges.  I would like to discuss the details of a bill. What is this base fee, are there other plans available? Are we getting any value in using cingular ( especially this plan). How many minutes are we getting what are the  long distance and roaming rates? 

In aggregate, my monthly cell phone bill for my group looks to be around $1,400 - $ 2,000/mth for 7 people total and this is a little high. 

Also, pls verify who has cell phones in Denver and what the monthly bills look like for this office.

Right now the SCE QFs are negotiating with SCE on 2 major points:  when will they be paid for the outstanding receivables (est. at $1.3 B for SCE and about $1.0 B for PG&E)  and when will the 5 yr fixed price SRAC of 5.37 cents/kw apply for those that have selected this option.  Right now SCE appears to be indicating that they will be paying the receivable sometime around June/July of 2002 and that the 5.37 price would apply at that time or as much as 4 months after that.  The logic is that they are trying to indicate that the MOU, if it had been passed, would not have applied at least until that time.

I have sent original contracts for execution.  We now have to put the deal in the system.  This is a little complicated.  

The attached spreadsheet indicates how this deal will work, using June as an example.  The only differences between June and future months are:

1)  In the future, we will collect a $.09/MMBtu demand charge with $.02/MMBtu of this going to EAMR (ENA gets $.07/MMBtu)
2)  In the future, the PG&E discount is $.10, not $.25.

Some of the complicated booking issues are:

1.  We need to show the John Cogan commission as a separate deal and a cost to ENA
2.  We need to show the payment to EAMR as a separate deal and a cost to ENA
3.  We will continue to bill Citizens for the TW Mainline cost on our utility deal

1 and 2 above are pretty straight forward and should not create any deal entry difficulties other than someone will have to enter the deals.  Number 3 is more difficult.  The complexities relate to where we are making the sale and what costs should be included.  

Can you get with the folks who can help us here and have them come up with a recommendation on how this deal should be booked?  Let me know if you have questions.  I also believe I can add value in speaking with Darren Giron or others.  I guaranty their initial recommendation will not be 100% workable.

Sorry for not getting back to you. The Power MTM positions are approx $570,000 and all related to physical positions with a total Net Power  position of approx $1.2MM. I have been working with Beverly Ikeda of Puget on the issues and so far so good. Puget is going to deliver a $10MM  Letter of Credit to cover the financial positions. From our conversations, her traders do not anticipate hedging any further and really only need access to short term EOL business. In addition, she and I discussed the needs of bilateral contracts with margining rights to prevent a similar situation from occurring in the future. 

Thanks,

Unbundling:	 PG&E has a Gas Accord in effect through 12/31/03, which is generally positive.  We will participate in the development of a successor plan, and attempt to improve it if we can.
  		SoCalGas attempted its own version of a gas accord, but the CPUC refused to approve.  We will attempt to resurrect this accord and obtain CPUC approval. 

Hedging:  No proceeding currently exists to address gas hedging by LDCs.  (draft legislation does exist on the electric side to allow hedging and passthrough of costs).  Jeff has recommended that we approach the LDCs to begin discussing the issue and developing a strategy to take to the CPUC.  I suggest we develop an ENA-EES hedging proposal for CA and then take that to the LDCs.  I will attempt to put this is writing.

Infrastructure:  CPUC has undertaken a proceeding to determine the need to improve infrastructure.  SoCal Gas and PG&E are responding with proposals.  We want to revitalize the infrastructure and ensure real markets exist and can develop.  Our task is to participate in these proceedings.

Did any of the gas commercial people respond?  Also, any communications from ENA and Barry T. on this?

Subject:	Southwest Gas filing in Nevada

You may remember that Southwest Gas filed a tariff revision in Nevada that would keep a transportation customer who returns to sales on sales for a term of 5 years.  They modified that request to grandfather customers who returned as a result of this past winter's fiasco.  We filed an opposition to this tariff change back in April (I think it was).  Anyway, the PUC of Nevada has scheduled a hearing on the SW filing for Sept. 24 and I need to know if this is an issue you want to pursue.  I can attend, or I can have outside counsel attend, or we can skip it and rely on our written comments. IF we want to file testimony, it would be due 9/17.  Please let me know what you would like me to do on this.  Thanks."

Send me a note when you get back and we can set up a meeting then.

Also, I received a notice from the IRS and it appears that they were
missing information on my wife and as such disallowed me claiming her as
a dependent.  I will send to your attention to review and clarify. Based
on my filing and actual refund there is about a $ 1k difference which I
believe is owed to me.

Subject: Counselling


Good morning Barry,

Just to let you know that I am on holidays August 11-26, so your
counselling will have to be this week or when I return.

Did Enron provide you with approval for a ""Post Arrival
Consultation""/PAC?
This is the counselling our PwC Houston office does.  (So, in effect
there
are two possible counselling sessions for assignees - the predeparture
counselling you are supposed to receive before you depart Canada and
then
there's the PAC).  PwC Houston is prepared to set up the ""PAC"" - they
simply want to know if you received approval for it.

Thanks,

From ""Order Denying Rehearing and Accepting Compliance Filing"", issued  March 19, 2001, Mississippi Canyon Gas Pipeline, LLC, Docket No. RP00-226-002 and -003 (94 FERC ? 61,324)

Prior Solicitation of Capacity Turnback

BP claims (Petition at 4-7) that MCGP should be required to solicit the voluntary turnback of capacity from its shippers prior to requiring them to submit production profiles.  As BP correctly notes (Petition at 4-5), the Commission did state in the Northern Border case that a pipeline should solicit turnback capacity from its shippers before filing an application to construct expansion facilities.

7Northern Border Pipeline Company, 90 FERC ? 61,263 at 61,879 (2000).


From ""Order Issuing Certificate"", issued March 16, 2000, Northern Border Pipeline Company, Docket Nos. CP99-21-000, CP99-21-001, and CP99-21-002 (90 FERC ? 61,263)

Further, we find below that Northern Border properly applied the Commission's policy regarding the solicitation of turnback capacity.  (from Footnote 46)

and

We conclude that Northern Border properly complied with the Commission's requirement that pipelines solicit turnback capacity before filing an application for authority to construct new capacity.


Do you want to talk to them again before we send them a letter?  Let me know what they say."

I think that a history of the general activity will help identify the problem and/or potential problem.

ENA East Gas has been working with all of the major Northeast clients (New Jersey Natural, PSE&G, NUI, South Jersey, KeySpan etc.) on gas products and services.  EES has requested that the Regulatory Affairs group use their contacts with those clients to get EES in to meet with Sr. Management.  These are ENA's primary target markets.
The West and Central groups within ENA have witnessed the same encroachment with EES requesting wholesale customer lists and contacts.
Texas has bumped into EES more in the industrial sector then in the LDC/IOU client base.
EES Product Approach - As I understand it EES is proposing to support regulatory changes (where needed) that would allow the wholesale entity to provide market based products and services to retail clients in exchange for EES being the exclusive provider of such product/service to the wholesale entity for redelivery to the retail entity.  To date, I am not aware of any actual proposals that have been provided.  However, as you can see the approach creates confusion for our customers.

I would like to confirm EES's product/service offering and determine from them if they are directly approaching our wholesale customers.

employee of Enron North America and previously was an  employee of Enron
Canada in Calgary.

As we had discussed at the time of my filing, I was  never given any
advise
on my relocation to the U.S. regarding tax issues, As  such I am not
sure
what some of my next moves should be.?I very much  require some
assistance?regarding spousal employment. My wife is a  registered nurse
and
would like to work in the U.S., but I have been advised  that this may
affect my filing in the U.S. and perhaps could cost me more in  U.S.
Taxes.

Can we set up a meeting to discuss strategies on  making sure I am going
about this properly.

This is my home e-mail address, you can contact me  here or at my work
address, Barry.Tycholiz@enron.com.

Thanks in advance.

BT

Mark/Barry--- I finally had a chance to look this week at the Colorado PUC proposed rulemaking amendments regarding price risk management (PRM) for gas utilities.  As we had generally talked about, the appetite for meaningful change to the PUCs rules has been pretty weak by staff and to a great extent by the Commissioners themselves.  These proposed rules reflect some movement toward encouraging utilties to implement PRM, but does NOT require them to implement, nor is there a clear statement that the PUC will allow recovery of costs.  Here's a short list of what's in the rules:

	> costs related to prm may be allowed, and new language is added to better define the standard of review as ""whether the utility action was reasonable in light of the information known, or should have been known, at the time of action or inaction"".    

	> in the utility's annual Gas PUrchase Plan they must include an exhibit that describes and analyzes the steps the utility has taken to reduce gas price volatility.  It appears to be an informational filing only, but clearly signals that the PUC expects them to take some action or explain why they didn't. 

	> the utility's actual portfolio purchases, included in the costs of purchasing risk managment products,  need to be included in a Gas Purchase Report to be filed annually. This report presumably is the document that the PUC will then use to determine reasonableness of gas cost pass thru.


There are numerous areas that we could comment on in this proposed rulemaking---anywhere from pushing them to be more explicit in advocating that the utility must do prm and that they will recover the costs, to something along the line of turning over their gas supply portfolio to a company that can more effectively manage it.  There is a hearing scheduled for November 1 in Denver, with comments due on or before October 21.  

We would be happy to intervene and file comments in the proceeding and work the issue if you guys would like us to. Might be kind of fun to tweak our friends at Xcel just a bit! Is there a time on Monday Oct 8 or Tuesday Oct 9 that we could talk via phone to determine your level of interest?  I am available mid day on Monday (between 10 and 2:30 central) or Tuesday anytime up until about 3:30.  Please let me know via return e mail or give me a call   #612-339-4599"

I attach a copy of the presentation we gave to Eric Gonzales last week.  Based on our analysis and the information we received from yourself and gas traders here and in Portland, we made certain assumptions about how the NW Pipeline system works.  During our planned meeting on Friday (we will learn for sure whether the meeting is taking place only on Wednesday -- Kirk Morgan will be reporting for jury duty that day and will let us know whether he's released or not), we wanted to confirm that our conclusions are correct, whether the LNG terminal idea is completely crazy and whether there are any synergies that we may get from working with NW P/L and/or Williams on LNG terminal development.

Please let me know what you think,

I've asked Randy Rich to look into the other aspects of your questions, which we'll discuss shortly.
The Commission has a two-step process for determining whether the market finds an expansion project economically viable. The first step, which occurs prior to the certificate application, is for the pipeline to conduct an open season in which existing customers are given an opportunity to permanently relinquish their capacity. This first step ensures that a pipeline will not expand capacity if the demand for that capacity can be filled by existing shippers relinquishing their capacity.  The second step is that the expansion shippers must be willing to purchase capacity at a rate that pays the full costs of the project, without subsidy from existing shippers through rolled-in pricing. 
The reverse open season requirement (i.e., the requirement that a pipeline give customers the opportunity to turn back capacity) is established Commission policy.  It was stated in the Commission's Pricing Policy for New and Existing Facilities Constructed by Interstate Natural Gas Pipelines, 71 FERC P61,241 at p. 61,917 (1995), reh'g denied, 75 FERC P61,105, and later reiterated in Certification on New interstate Natural Gas Pipeline Facilities (Certificate Policy Statement), 88 FERC P61,227 (1999), order clarifying statement of policy, 90 FERC P61,128, order further clarifying statement of policy, 92 FERC P61,094 (2000).  
My research has indicated that the Commission has provided few specifics on how a reverse open season is to be conducted.  This probably allows pipelines considerable discretion in how they conduct their solicitations of turnback.  General Commission policy would probably require only that shippers be given adequate notice of and opportunity to respond to the reverse open season.  If the procedure used by El Paso for soliciting turnback becomes an issue, please let me know and let's discuss it.  I'll be up in a few minutes for our call to Randy.

 Energy: Firm accused of price gouging ends arguments, though judge warned there's evidence it manipulated market.

By RICARDO ALONSO-ZALDIVAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER


WASHINGTON -- A Texas natural gas conglomerate accused of price gouging in California unexpectedly rested its case Monday, even though a judge warned that the state has presented credible evidence the company attempted to take unfair advantage of the energy crisis.

Judge Curtis L. Wagner Jr. of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission said he had wanted El Paso Corp. to present witnesses to explain tape-recorded phone calls that he says raised suspicions of an inside deal to manipulate California's natural gas market.

The California Public Utilities Commission is alleging that El Paso created artificial natural gas shortages last year, helping drive electricity prices to record levels. The state wants FERC to order refunds of at least $184 million. But the company said its critics had not presented any new evidence and had failed to prove their allegations. FERC's governing board had initially dismissed complaints of insider dealing, but it recently authorized Wagner to take a closer look.

""If anything happens here, I am sure it is going to be all political,"" said El Paso spokeswoman Norma Dunn. ""There is absolutely no new evidence. FERC already looked at this the first time and found that El Paso did not violate any rules. How can they come back and say we did?""

Kevin Lipson, a lawyer for plaintiff Southern California Edison, called El Paso's decision ""one of the dumber moves I've ever seen"": valid from a legal standpoint but ""a public relations disaster. . . . The judge is saying we're going to have to draw our own conclusions if they don't present witnesses.""

The case is considered the closest thing to a full-blown trial of allegations that corporate scheming--not merely an imbalance of supply and demand--contributed to California's energy woes.

At issue is a controversial contract between two subsidiaries of the Houston-based company: El Paso Natural Gas Co., a pipeline regulated by FERC; and El Paso Merchant Energy, an energy marketing company.

The marketing company last year acquired the right to ship 1.2 billion cubic feet of natural gas a day through a critical pipeline serving Southern California. CPUC alleges that Merchant used inside information to win the deal and later withheld supplies of gas to drive up prices. Once the contract expired May 31 and some 30 other companies acquired the shipping rights, natural gas prices plunged.

Wagner, FERC's chief administrative law judge, has until early October to render an initial decision to the agency's governing board. FERC has the power to order the return of any ill-gotten profits, but the company would likely appeal such a penalty to the federal courts.

A few weeks ago, Wagner dismissed Gov. Gray Davis' demand for $8.9 billion in electricity refunds from out-of-state suppliers. In the El Paso case, however, he has been a thorn in the side of industry.

El Paso chief executive William Wise had been expected to take the stand Monday afternoon, when the company abruptly shifted its strategy in a dramatic legal gambit.

Dan Collins, an El Paso attorney, told the judge that the company would rest its case. Collins held out the possibility that Wise might yet testify, but only to answer questions from the judge, not from plaintiff's lawyers.

After a short recess, Wagner returned to the hearing room and ruled that CPUC had met its initial burden of proof--akin to finding probable cause in a criminal trial.

""I do find that the complainant has made a prima facie case and the burden of proof now shifts to El Paso,"" Wagner said. When El Paso's lawyers tried to respond, Wagner ordered them to ""please be seated.""

Wagner said he was disturbed by transcripts of conversations taped in February 2000 between Robin Cox, an official of El Paso Merchant, and Harvey Rodman, an official of yet another El Paso subsidiary, Mojave Pipeline Co.

Cox was seeking a shipping discount from Mojave a few days before Merchant finalized its bid. The Mojave pipeline would provide an alternative route into Southern California in case of shipping bottlenecks.

Securing the Mojave discount made the El Paso contract more valuable for Merchant, the plaintiffs allege. In one taped conversation, Cox asks Rodman to refrain from publicly posting the discount for a few days. Plaintiffs allege that other shippers might have competed with Merchant for El Paso's capacity had they known a discount was available on Mojave.

But Merchant official Mark Mitchell testified that the Mojave discount was of no real importance in the company's decision to enter into the deal.

The judge wanted to know more. He urged El Paso Corp. to produce Cox and Rodman as witnesses.

""If ever a deal was being made . . . the words are clear,"" said Wagner. ""It's all buddy-buddy stuff.""

The judge said he was concerned that the Cox-Rodman conversations violated FERC rules that require pipelines to maintain arm's-length relationships with marketing affiliates.

CPUC attorney Harvey Morris, who has spearheaded the case against El Paso, said the judge's ruling made it clear that Merchant obtained preferential treatment.

Morris said he was baffled that El Paso chose not to bring on more witnesses, despite the judge's warning.

""If I were in their shoes,"" said Morris, ""unless I had something to hide, I'd call my witnesses and give them another chance to defend themselves.""

Responded William Scherman, a lawyer for Merchant: ""You make a judgment that you have produced evidence that is sufficient to win your case, and we believe we have done that.""

Price gouging case strong, judge says
El Paso Corp. executives decline to testify -- hearing cut short

A federal regulatory judge buoyed California's hopes for a major refund on energy costs yesterday when he said the state had presented credible evidence that a giant Texas natural gas company broke the rules against favoring an affiliate.

Curtis L. Wagner, the chief administrative law judge for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, said lawyers for the state had made a convincing case that the El Paso Corp. acted improperly. He urged El Paso executives to rebut the allegations.

But they declined, bringing an unexpectedly sudden end to the evidentiary hearing in Washington, D.C., and boosting the spirits of California officials who have asked the regulatory commission to order El Paso Corp. to refund up to $200 million.

Wagner plans to file a recommended decision to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission by Oct. 9.

At issue is an allegation by the state Public Utilities Commission that El Paso rigged the bidding for use of its natural gas pipeline in Southern California last year. The PUC said El Paso steered a huge block of crucial pipeline space to its own marketing affiliate, effectively freezing out competitors.

The PUC, utilities, say that El Paso's pipeline division and its marketing arm then cooperated to choke off the flow of gas to the state, setting off increases in the price of natural gas -- as well as in the price of electricity from gas-fired power plants.

Wagner said internal El Paso memos and transcripts support the first part of the state's allegations: that El Paso violated federal regulations that prohibit coordination between regulated natural gas pipelines and their unregulated affiliates, which are required to operate independently.

""The California Public Utilities Commission had shown a prima facie case, and the burden of proof shifted to the other side,"" Wagner told The Chronicle yesterday. ""Now I have to look at the whole record and decide the case.""

El Paso denies the allegations that it improperly shared information about the bidding process with the marketing affiliate and arranged discounts.

Top executives, including El Paso Corp. chief executive officer William Wise, had flown to Washington to testify at Wagner's suggestion.

""I told them what I thought they needed to do to show there was no affiliate abuse or no (market manipulation),"" Wagner said. But he said the company had the right to cut the hearing short and rely on the evidence already presented. ""That's up to them.""

Whatever penalties the commission might impose, they could be dwarfed by damages sought in a series of private ratepayer lawsuits against El Paso. Those suits claim the company is largely responsible for billions of dollars in skyrocketing energy costs suffered by Californians over the past 18 months..


AMOUNTS TO CONCESSION
The decision to keep executives off the witness stand yesterday amounted to a concession that El Paso violated Federal Energy Regulatory Commission regulations against affiliate abuse, asserted PUC attorney Harvey Morris.

""I infer from their actions it was not going to get any better (if executives testified),"" Morris said. ""They were doing damage control.""

El Paso spokeswoman Norma Dunn denied that the company has conceded wrongdoing.

""That's absolutely insane,"" said Dunn.

Wagner said transcripts of a telephone conversation between an employee of El Paso's marketing arm, El Paso Merchant Energy, and one of its pipeline affiliates ""tend to show there was communication between the marketing agency and the pipeline."" The two were discussing discounts.

""It looked like hanky-panky,"" Wagner said. The judge said he was also influenced that a memo outlining El Paso Merchant Energy's strategy for boosting profits from its pipeline contract was shared with the top executive for the company's pipeline division.

Today's GD reports that the Colorado PUC is seeking public comments on policy changes necessary to provide price stability for customers.  The article states that the PUC is seeking comments on 3 methods:  (1) requiring utilities to hedge more of their gas supply; (2) requiring utilities to offer an optional service that would be less volatile than standard offer service; and (3) implementing gas unbundling to give customers supplier choice. 

Apparently, the Commission has received comments from the state's LDCs (and maybe others, although the article didn't speak to them).  It is asking for another round of comments, which are due June 18th.

I recommend that we file comments which advocate our hedging proposal, including weather products.

Barry,

My name is Alisha Mahabir and I have been working on negotiating the MGI/ENA GISB.  I have been in contact with Lourdes Cervantes at MGI; her phone number is 525-232-5990.  There are still a few issues left to be resolved before we can proceed with the execution of this document.  Per Geral Nemec's request, I will outline these changes as they are addressed in Exhibit B to the GISB that was sent over by Lourdes.

Initially I want to note that some changes must be made to the front page of the GISB.  MGI has previously agreed to allow ENA to be the confirming party under Section 2.5.  Additionally, there have been a few problems with allowing payment to be made on the 30th day of the month.  It appears that MGI has been construing this provision broadly so as to make payment on the 2nd day of March after a short month in February.  Thus, we would like Section 7.2 to read ""30th day or, for the Month of February, on the last day of the Month"".  

As for Exhibit B, the changes are as follows:

#4 The words ""or interruptible"" should be deleted from this provision.  The interruptible language conflicts with the ability to do 30 day firm deals under this contract.

#11 This provision deals with when notices are deemed received.  The provision as written provides that notice by first class mail is deemed received 2 business days after mailing.  MGI would like to change this to allow for receipt to mean actual receipt.  Lourdes told me that she will check to see whether the change can be stricken or at least to extend 2 business days to 3 business days.

#12 (a) MGI has agreed to strike the term ""letter"" from the requirement that the Parent issue a guarantee should doubt arise as to Enron's ability to pay.  
      (b)  Originally the GISB provides that a contract can be terminated without prior notice should certain conditions be met.  MGI wants to change this to require the parties to provide 48 hours notice.  Lourdes told me that she would check to see whether this could be changed to 24 hours prior notice.

#16  The language designating ICC is acceptable, however any redundant language should be stricken.

If this memo is at all unclear, please feel free to call me.  My extension is 52722.  

Alisha Mahabir"

This is the insurance language that would appear in the contract between Enron Asset Management Resources (EAMR) and Citizens.  I will send you a second e-mail that summarizes the proposed deal between EAMR and ENA.  As we discussed I would like you to look at this insurance arrangement and see if ENA has any risk.  My view of it is that this creates no risk to ENA, but I have not structured a deal in this way before and would appreciate a second opinion. 

Thanks

Subject: RE: Stock Options after merger


Tyrell,

The following is the information that we have been provided thus far
regarding your questions below.  If the merger between Enron and Dynegy
closes, all terms and provisions of the option awards before the close are
preserved through and after the close except:

(1) number of options in Dynegy will be number of Enron options before the
merger times the merger ration of .2685

(2) the strike price for Dynegy options will be the strike price of Enron
options before the merger divided by the merger ration of .2685

The proposed transaction is considered an ""approved"" change in control for
purposes of the Enron Corp. stock plans.

I hope this helps with some of the questions.  If you have further questions
that I have not answered I would refer you back to Enron for clarification.

What happens to the Enron options after the merger?
Are all options vested upon completion of the merger?
What happens to the number of options and the strike price, given the
ratio of 1 share of ENA = .2685 share of DYN?

Subject:	RE: Block III Recall Rights

Steph:  Exactly what are you looking for - I'm not sure we could give you an opinion of the mechanics.  If you remember, we looked at this issue back in March and I sent you the e-mail message below.  Since then, FERC has issued orders in Docket No. RP00-241 on 3/28/2001 and 6/11/2001 which reaffirmed its rulings in the orders discussed below.  There is no discussion in any of the orders on the specific mechanics of the recall other than what I already noted, namely, if the capacity has been recalled by El Paso or a shipper to serve a PG&E market, and the original shipper wants it back, it can re-recall the recalled capacity on 24 hours notice as long as it is using all of its other Block II capacity.  If you need something more ""legal"", we'll see what we can do.  If we have to go to Bracewell for a law firm legal opinion, there would be a charge since they'd have to do the same research before they could sign off on one.

Subject:	Re: block II  

I would note also that the recent reallocation of Topock rights takes care of one of the issues -- namely that El Paso allowed Dynegy to take Block II capacity to SoCal Topock.  The 4/14/00 order should have taken care of it, except for El Paso's position that they had capacity at Topock in the aggregate so they weren't overselling it.  

Order Date	Block II Rulings	
6/14/2000 Denial of Rehearing by Operation of Law	Denies Indicated Shippers request for rehearing of 4/14/00 order.	
4/14/2000 Order on Rehearing (Enron)	Clarifies the January 19 order to provide that El Paso may remarket the PG&E turnback capacity, including Block II, for primary delivery to delivery points other than PG&E Topock if capacity is available at those other delivery points.	
1/19/2000 Order on Negotiated Rate Transactions  (Enron & Williams)	Block II capacity has primary delivery rights only at PG&E Topock and alternative rights at the other Topock delivery points. Rejects CPUC argument against the recall provisions, which are the same as ultimately accepted in the Dynegy deal (see 10/19/99, 7/29/99, 9/17/98 and 6/11/98 orders) and provide (1) that there is no right of recall if the Block II capacity is simply idle, (2) that the capacity may be recalled if it is being used to serve points other than those behind PG&E Topock, and (3) if so recalled, it may be recalled by the original shipper for its own use in the PG&E service territory upon 24 hours notice. Clarifies, as in Dynegy, that the shipper (Enron) must use all its other Block II capacity before recalling other Block II capacity, but is not required to use Block I or Block III capacity first.	
10/19/1999 Order on Rehearing and Clarification (Dynegy)	Denies rehearing of 7/29/99 order 	
7/29/1999 Order on Rehearing and Compliance Filing (Dynegy)	 Affirms that PG&E and the CPUC are entitled to have the Block II capacity recalled to northern California even if it is under contract [to Dynegy]. Reverses previous ruling -- does not require that all other capacity to California be utilized before Block II capacity can be recalled. Per Settlement, recalling shipper must pay max rate to recall if its contract is one month or less.  If for more than one month, the rate must equal or exceed the rate of the existing shipper. On 24 hours notice, the existing shipper (i.e., Dynegy) may recall for its own use to serve northern California markets, capacity that was recalled for use by other shippers, even if those shippers are willing to pay a higher rate. Clarifies that if the Block II capacity is idle but is not being used to serve areas outside of northern California, [Dynegy] may hold the capacity without any obligation to release it.	
9/17/1998 Letter Order on Compliance Filing	Requires the Dynegy/El Paso agreement to clearly state that Block II capacity was recallable even though Dynegy had a minimum take requirement. Requires El Paso to eliminate use of alternative delivery points as the defining point for the service that would be recalled -- issue is markets served, not delivery points. Requires elimination of a clause requiring recalling shipper to submit a sworn statement that no capacity was available on other pipelines.	
6/11/1998 	Shippers in northern California cannot recall Block II capacity simply because it is not actually being used by [Dynegy]. Block II is recallable if [Dynegy] is using it to serve end users not within PG&E's service territory. Shippers who want to recall Block II capacity must have an actual need and may only recall if firm capacity is not available to PG&E's service territory via El Paso or via any other pipeline available to the shipper.

Subject:	Block III Recall Rights

Further to our discussions about our EPNG capacity: 

Our research had resulted in an opinion that there is little value associated with PG&E's (northern CA customers) recall rights on Block III capacity.  While it was not part of the original settlement, the 24 hour RE-recall rights to the shipper of record appear to give PG&E a DAILY call on capacity at best. 

Because we have pieced this opinion together based upon rulings in various proceedings, we would like a more formal regulatory/legal opinion of the mechanics of the RE-recall provision that has been developed over time. Is this something that either of you can provide or should it go to Randy? The results of this inquiry will set the tone of our next round of dicussions with EPNG.

 By the way, still waiting on their written reponse to our letter..... I think they have bigger fish to fry.

Please advise.

Stephanie

Yep - in fact, they did.  I just haven't got around to summarizing the order yet.  Here's some excerpts: 

""We reach no determination regarding whether PG&E Transmission's system-wide cost of fuel will increase above the current cost, since the outcome depends on numerous factors, such as the total pipeline volumes transported and the price of fuel.  Instead, as discussed below, and in accordance with Enron's request [way to go, FERC!!], we will act to insulate existing shippers from increased fuel costs attributable to the proposed expansion.""

After suggesting that it would have been more appropriate to calculate fuel costs by using the average of the latest twelve months of actual data in place of the theoretical maximum rate, FERC directed ""PG&E Transmission to design a surcharge to ensure that expansion shippers are subject to an incremental fuel charge for fuel costs above the costs attributable to fuel absent the proposed addition of 97,500 horsepower of compression.  In addition, PG&E must indicate compliance with this condition whenever it files to adjust its compressor fuel surcharge and whenever it files its annual gas fuel reimbursement reports.""

Subject:        Kern River 2002 Expansion Project (CP01-31) 

According to the Draft Order that was voted out at the Commission meeting today, the subject project, as amended to reflect the approval of the California Action Project, is approved, subject to certain conditions including restrictions on rolled-in rate treatment.  

The Commission was concerned that the additional fuel costs could exceed the rate reduction to existing shippers.  Kern River's projections were based on a $3.00/dth cost of gas.  The Commission conditioned its approval of rolled-in rate treatment by providing that, ""in its future compliance tariff filing to roll-in the costs and lower transmission rates, Kern River must submit revised exhibits showing the excess revenues over the incremental cost-of-service, and the net benefits after anticipated fuel costs are considered"" (Kern River's settlement in RP99-274 requires it to reduce its rates for existing customers coincident with the in-service date for newly certificated facilities if it receives approval for rolled-in rate treatment).  Additionally, if during any year, the combined level of the electric and gas fuel expenses exceed the benchmark level(s) of excess revenues established in the tariff filing, then Kern River must allocate the excess portion of fuel costs to its expansion shippers.  Thus, Kern River must always assure that this expansion does not increase costs for existing shippers.

The Commission rejected concerns of the existing firm shippers as well as SoCal Gas about the potential for additional curtailment at Wheeler Ridge.  The Commission found that the potential for increased curtailment did not warrant rejection or modification of Kern River's proposal, in part because SoCal Gas does not offer firm service on its system and therefore existing shippers have never had any assurance that Socal Gas would accept their gas.  

The Draft Order is 49 pages long.  Please advise if you would like a hard copy."

Enron's answer reiterates the comments it filed in the original proceeding, namely that the Commission should consolidate this proceeding with the complaint filed in RP01-484 by the Joint Complainants (producers, California LDCs) which also deals with issues of adequacy of capacity.  We also reiterate and emphasize our original proposal that the Commission require El Paso to immediately give existing firm shippers the opportunity to turn back capacity they no longer need as one means of making additional capacity available to those who need more.

Mark, 

Thank you for your help identifying the right speaker for the ZEG/NW Gas Association Conference in Portland - October 3.  I have attached an advanced draft agenda so you can see the line up of executives and topics. We certainly hope that Enron will agree to speak and sponsor....I would recommend the reception sponsorship....I believe a good value for the $.....see attached letter to David Fuller re sponsorship and Sponsorship Detail Sheet. 

As you will see from the agenda, the topic is PRICE...natural gas price.....what I believe would be of interest is the relationship between gas and electric prices in the West....factoring hydro etc.,......identifying the wildcards.... 

The morning of Day 2 is high level - CEO discussions of DEMAND - consumer/industry/gas fired gen and PRICE...as I said Enron - as largest marketer in NA - should be the company delivering the discussion. - This is a GAS industry conference - not a ""public"" forum.  Louise Kitchen would be an great choice - I've heard she is an excellent presenter - and I believe of equivalent stature to the other a.m. presenters....... 

Thanks...... please give me a call as soon as you can after the holiday.

Subject:	More Info: PG&E to Announce Open Season on Redwood and Baja Early Next Week

PG&E will announce via press release very early next week an open season on Redwood, Baja and Silverado.
It comes in direct response to recent announcements of expansions into California by pipelines.
The bid protocols will be structured similar to original open season from the original Gas Accord.
The open season will start on June 1 and end on July 31.
Capacity will be available starting 1.1.03.
Bidders will be able to bid up to 30 years (PG&E states that that's what generators want).
Accompanying the announcement will be another announcement that PG&E will expand Redwood by 200mmcf/day, which they hope to have available by 1.1.03, or some time during Q103.
About 2-4 weeks after the open season begins, PG&E will file its proposed ""Gas Accord II,""  (the first one expires end of 02).
As part of that filing, PG&E will offer its proposed ratemaking treatment for the next five years (beginning 1.1.03).
PG&E will not include in the open season 1) core capacity and 2) certain EAD contracts that extend beyond the Gas Accord 1 end date.
In addition, PG&E will hold back an additional 20% (after excluding core and EAD), to be ""open-seasoned"" at some ""future"" date.
The capacity to be auctioned is: 1) 900 mmcf/day on Redwood, 2) 245 (annual) on Baja, plus an additional 200/day in summer on Baja, 3) 155 on Silverado.
How PG&E will market the 20% they intend to hold back, and when they might auction it off in the future will be discussed in PG&E's Gas Accord II filing.
No single company will be awarded more than 30% of the capacity on any specific path in the primary open season (though firms can bid whatever level of capacity they choose).

Please forwad along to anyone else who might be interested.  If you have any questions, just holler.

Best,
Jeff"

I thought you understood from my email and phone call that I was going to track down El Paso's interpretation of the 24 hours recall rights.  Regulatory treatment of the 58 million by PG&E is a CPUC issue.  I just talked to Becky and I don't have a good response to the question of whether our capacity could replace expansion capacity in light of the dueling recall rights, but I will think about it and talk to Becky some more.

As to the 24-hour recall, I can only tell you what the FERC order says, I have no special knowledge of how El Paso and the parties intended the 24 recall to work.  The order is fairly terse, and just says ""and if it so recalled (by PG&E), that Enron may further recall the capacity for its own use in the PG&E  service territory upon 24 hours notice.""  The language says to me that you can recall it 24 hours before you want to use it.  However, I can call El Paso and find out how they interpret it.

As to the ""traditional rate making"" valuation of the $58 million, I have to confess I don't understand what you mean.  PG&E paid the 58 million as part of a negotiated settlement.  Typically that is part of a black box settlement, meaning that revenue dollars are not tracked to particular costs.  We can pull the settlement and see if it stipulates some sort of treatment, but I would doubt it.  If your question relates to how PG&E is tracking that expense in a regulatory sense, perhaps Jeff Dasovich can find out.

When is the 24 hour notice on re-recall effective - 24 hours from the day of recall (varies depending on term) or 24 hours before the recall is supposed to start?

How would you value what's left of the $58 million that PG&E paid based upon traditional rate making policies? I believe there are at least 5 years left on the term of the settlement.

Please call if you have any questions,

I looked over all the orders and the contracts and I agree with both of your interpretation of the recall rights of Block II.  PG&E did not make a very smart deal for $58 million.

Mark/Barry--- I finally had a chance to look this week at the Colorado PUC proposed rulemaking amendments regarding price risk management (PRM) for gas utilities.  As we had generally talked about, the appetite for meaningful change to the PUCs rules has been pretty weak by staff and to a great extent by the Commissioners themselves.  These proposed rules reflect some movement toward encouraging utilties to implement PRM, but does NOT require them to implement, nor is there a clear statement that the PUC will allow recovery of costs.  Here's a short list of what's in the rules:

	> costs related to prm may be allowed, and new language is added to better define the standard of review as ""whether the utility action was reasonable in light of the information known, or should have been known, at the time of action or inaction"".    

	> in the utility's annual Gas PUrchase Plan they must include an exhibit that describes and analyzes the steps the utility has taken to reduce gas price volatility.  It appears to be an informational filing only, but clearly signals that the PUC expects them to take some action or explain why they didn't. 

	> the utility's actual portfolio purchases, included in the costs of purchasing risk managment products,  need to be included in a Gas Purchase Report to be filed annually. This report presumably is the document that the PUC will then use to determine reasonableness of gas cost pass thru.


There are numerous areas that we could comment on in this proposed rulemaking---anywhere from pushing them to be more explicit in advocating that the utility must do prm and that they will recover the costs, to something along the line of turning over their gas supply portfolio to a company that can more effectively manage it.  There is a hearing scheduled for November 1 in Denver, with comments due on or before October 21.  

We would be happy to intervene and file comments in the proceeding and work the issue if you guys would like us to. Might be kind of fun to tweak our friends at Xcel just a bit!

Subject: Regulatory / Fundamentals


Mike, further to our conversation of this week.. let's get together early next week... ( Tues ) to sit down and hash out expectations of Jane and Keith as they relate to your needs, my needs and how they mutally benefit our efforts.
 
I think we may have to formalize the reporting process on the regulatory but before I worry about that, I am more interested in you and me working out expectations... we may be far off as to what the priorities are and as such our regulatory focus may need to splinter.
 
I have decided to go up to Canada for a couple days to handle some family affairs.  I can be reached on my cell, otherwise I will talk to you on tues.

Dear Western Region:

	I would like to thank Phillip Allen for his leadership of the west desk for 2000 and 2001.  He will continue as Managing Director at Enron North America and trade a financial book for the natural gas trading group.  Phillip will be sitting near the western region and will continue to participate in our goal to analyze the western market fundamentals to maximize wholesale trading efforts.  I will be assuming all management responsibilities of the west trading group effective immediately.

	I would like to take the opportunity to discuss our new organization for the Western Region trading group.  I have organized a vertical based trading structure that clearly defines each employee's responsibilities going forward.   Our goal is to organize all of our efforts in the west such that we will offer Enron North America the most profitable wholesale trading model.

The most significant change to the western region organization will be Keith Holst's role as Director of West Fundamentals.  Keith will manage this unit from the west desk, while using the services of Enron's centralized fundamentals group, headed by Chris Gaskill.  Our western region Fundamentals group will be responsible for delivering the most complete and market sensitive data to the trading desk.  We will all share in Keith's efforts to make our fundamental analysis the standard for all trading units within the company.

West Origination, led by Barry Tycholiz, will play a larger role in our term trading efforts going forward.  They will be joining our desk for fundamental forecasting meetings and discussions.  Our goal is to capture a majority of the term risk management efforts of our customer base.  We must succeed in capturing a majority of our customers' business to increase our share of lower risk earnings.  This contribution, along with our wholesale trading, will help our desk beat earnings expectations consistently.     

The West trading organization is structured to maximize profitability by sub-region.  The emphasis for the trading group will be to increase profitability and market information from each trader's sub-region.   We will be evaluated on how we organize and build the business and profitability in our respective trading areas.  This structure, however, does not preclude west traders from trading positions throughout the Western region and the North American gas market.  The West trading organization will be successful by creating accountability for trading responsibilities.
  
Please review the attached outline for the new trading structure.  We will be meeting as a group to discuss the changes soon.  The implementation of this structure will rely on our back office to set up the new books for each trader.  

Sincerely,

Michael D. Grigsby
West Gas Trading

The matter was not discussed on our Western Wholesale call this morning either, since I did not become aware of it till later.  I would therefore like to receive input from Sue and others on our team about this, getting final sign off to proceed from Linda Robertson and Jim Steffes.  If we elect to proceed, it would be appropriate to bill all participating marketers in equal shares.  Thanks.  Ray

It is labeled ""Block II"" because PG&E owns recall rights on the entire block through 12/31/2005.  The ROFR rights that go with this capacity add a tremendous amount of value (i.e. market rates with short term commitment vs. 15 - 20 year obligation of new build)

Capacity currently has access to all supply basins. However, the current FERC proceedings on receipt point reallocations will probably result in a supply split of 60% San Juan and 40% Permian. 

Rates for the capacity and my Duke proposal are attached.

Wanted to make sure we protested the filing based on fuel treatment - page 10 description.  You and I have talked about their interpretation of the Transco ruling - we need to reinforce the currently effective FERC policy of incremental treatment for projects that would raise rates/fuel for existing shippers, regardless of their claim that their tariff does not provide for an incremental fuel charge.

I believe Newport Generation tried to get the previous incremental fuel ruling for the 2002 expansion overturned - they were unsuccessful. FERC's answer to that request may provide good language to cite......

Eric, I received your message on discussions with Energy West.  Firstly, I was unaware of any pricing discussions or notional prices being put out to the customer and I have not discussed with Dave, or Mark Whitt. With that being said, I am sure Dave is out marketing products and services to all of the Utilities in the PNW. 

With out a doubt, we need to discuss this effort as it relates to and creates conflict or duplicate coverage.. I look forward to the discussion and did try to call you earlier today to discuss directly.

I assume you received this information already and I know that we have not discussed Tyrell being ranked here.  The #1 spot was tightly held by only a few people ( in the americas and as such everyone was moved down... Although the forced ranking creates problems at time, I am satisfied that Ty's ranking is appropriate... 

let's discuss, BT

Below are the final PRC rankings for the Analysts and /or Associates who were assigned to you for the mid-year PRC process.  Please communicate these results to the appropriate supervisor.  PRC reviews with the Analysts and Associates should be completed by early August, and the signed evaluation forms should be returned to me at EB3539b.  The Program recommends that if asked, the supervisor should provide the actual ranking to the Analyst or Associate.  In addition, we recommend that the PRC representative be involved in providing feedback to the Analyst or Associate.

Harrison, Tyrell  G	Analyst-2	ENA	2/1/1999	Mr. Mark Whitt	2	No

1.	CIG, RP01-350
CIG  has filed an answer to the comments and protests.  Although they referenced our protest, they did not discuss it in any detail except to say that our issues and those of PSCo and Barrett could be explored through ""normal procedures"" after the suspension, presumably through settlement conferences or hearing.  Note that I gave you a copy, though I can't remember exactly when.  It might have been when we met with Paul in my office.

The suspension order was issued on 4/25 -- rates effective 10/1/01, subject to refund.  Copies were distributed to parties on my list on 4/30.  All of the issues in the ""Appendix B"" tariff sheets are set for the technical conference (basically, everything except the rates and cost of service, which are to be addressed at hearing).  The hearing schedule is held in abeyance until after the technical conference issues are resolved.  At that point, a procedural schedule will be established, with a target hearing date and dates for testimony, discovery, rebuttal testimony, etc.  Of course, settlement negotiations will also be going on at the same time, I would assume.

2.	PGT, CP01-141

The application was filed on 4/2, and interventions/protests were not due until 4/25.  As you know, certificate proceedings do not have the same requirement for FERC to act within 30 days.  Environmental issues will be of primary concern initially.  On 4/12, FERC issued a notice of intent to prepare an Environmental Assessment with reqeust for comments.   FERC sent PGT a data request on environmental issues, to which PGT responded on 4/30.  Interestingly, on 5/3, REBOUND, an organization of skilled construction trade workers, filed a letter arguing that a ""full and complete"" Environmental Impact Statement is the proper avenue for consideration of the environmental impacts of the project.  An EIS is much more extensive than an Environmental Assessment.  REBOUND's justification for an EIS didn't seem to be very strong.  

While the environmental work is ongoing, FERC will probably issue a preliminary determination on the non-environmental issues.  If RIMS is correct, there weren't many protests -- only us, DEK Energy Company, and Pan Alberta Gas -- and only PanCanadian Petroleum filed comments.

Judy, you were?assigned to my U.S and Canadian  tax returns. I am a
employee of Enron North America and previously was an  employee of Enron
Canada in Calgary.

As we had discussed at the time of my filing, I was  never given any advise
on my relocation to the U.S. regarding tax issues, As  such I am not sure
what some of my next moves should be.?I very much  require some
assistance?regarding spousal employment. My wife is a  registered nurse and
would like to work in the U.S., but I have been advised  that this may
affect my filing in the U.S. and perhaps could cost me more in  U.S. Taxes.

Can we set up a meeting to discuss strategies on  making sure I am going
about this properly.

This is my home e-mail address, you can contact me  here or at my work
address, Barry.Tycholiz@enron.com.

Thanks in advance.

Hi, I'm back.

Please fax the IRS notice to me at the number below if you haven't
already
and I'll review it for you.

Regarding the counselling session, I am available tomorrow all day,
Wednesday afternoon after 1:30pm, Thursday afternoon after 2pm and
Friday
after 2pm.  Next week I'll be out of the office Tuesday and Wednesday as
well as Thursday afternoon.  The next week I am out of the office on a

Will any of these time slots work for you?

Send me a note when you get back and we can set up a meeting then.

Also, I received a notice from the IRS and it appears that they were
missing information on my wife and as such disallowed me claiming her as
a dependent.  I will send to your attention to review and clarify. Based
on my filing and actual refund there is about a $ 1k difference which I
believe is owed to me.

Good morning Barry,

Just to let you know that I am on holidays August 11-26, so your
counselling will have to be this week or when I return.

Did Enron provide you with approval for a ""Post Arrival
Consultation""/PAC?
This is the counselling our PwC Houston office does.  (So, in effect
there
are two possible counselling sessions for assignees - the predeparture
counselling you are supposed to receive before you depart Canada and
then
there's the PAC).  PwC Houston is prepared to set up the ""PAC"" - they
simply want to know if you received approval for it.

Thanks,

Mike, here is a very brief overview of planned or approved expansions by major pipeline.  There is a lot of detail that supports each of these pipe expansions including, proposed start dates, delivery points, probability etc... 

Let's discuss needs... 

Perhaps, we can give your group a general overview on expansions in the west, current status etc.

Importance:	High

Attached are three documents (cover memo, draft settlement proposal,
settlement procedures timeline) comprising SRP's formal proposal to resolve
five pending dockets, RP99-507 (Indicated Shippers' Complaint), RP00-336
(Order No. 637 Allocation and Pooling Issues only), RP99-139 (ONEOK
Complaint), RP01-484 (Indicated Shippers/California Complaint), and RP01-486
(Texas, New Mexico and Arizona Shippers' Complaint). We appreciate the
suggestions received to date and believe that while an uncontested
settlement may be unlikely, a sufficient nucleus is forming around the
elements of this proposal that will lead to the filing of an Offer of
Settlement and ultimate FERC approval as in the public interest.  We
encourage your active participation in this process.

Note that while Advisory Staff present at the July 18 Technical Conference
is aware conceptually that SRP will be distributing a settlement proposal,
this proposal has not been distributed to the Advisory Staff.  This proposal
has been sent to Rick Miles, Director, Dispute Resolution Services, for
informational purposes only at this time.

These comments on FERC's proposed gas reporting requirements are due on June 18.  The draft takes the position that the FERC should NOT adopt reporting requirements for natural gas sellers, which is a different approach than some of you had discussed earlier.  If after reading my very persuasive comments, the consensus is we should not oppose the reporting requirements but rather attempt to water them down, I will of course rewrite the comments (or resign in protest).

On page 6, I make the argument that we do not do our business in the manner the reporting requirements seem to contemplate.  I go through a very high level description of our ""books,"" but I really do not want to be more specific, as we then get into proprietary matters.  Where we have given FERC the more detailed description, we have asked for confidential treatment.

Please get comments back to me and Becky as quickly as you can.  Thanks.

As some of you might already know, I resigned today.  I feel fortunate and blessed to have had this experience here at Enron.  Not only have I learned a tremendous amount, but I also have met some very talented and unique people.  I am not 100% sure what I will do at this point, but I will probably be heading up to NYC in January.  I feel sad to end this chapter, yet excited as I begin a new one in my life.  

As always, it has been a pleasure working with you!  Keep in touch.  I will be interested to see what happens.

At this meeting, Dun & Bradstreet representative Karen Marcom will provide an overview of the Dun & Bradstreet marketing data that Enron will have access to through a global purchase agreement.  This data set is a monthly feed of marketing information, financial stress scores, energy demand estimators, family tree linkage and D&B credit scores, which is a subset of the full D&B database.  Karen will answer questions concerning the presentation of the data and how it will be accessed.

The Dun & Bradstreet database will be available to business units sharing in the cost of the database."

Paul,

Welcome back.  The Wyoming Governor's office wants to meet in August re energy issues.  I have identified the appropriate Enron nat gas people.  I would recommend a conference call with your Wyoming contact in advance of that meeting to determine if it makes sense to fly a lot of people to Wyoming.  Mark Whitt is based in Denver and focuses on nat gas marketing.  I believe he has had some discusions in the past with Wyoming re their royalty positions and will likely call to discuss. 

Scott Josey runs our producer finance business which finances/invests in upstream producers and projects.  He has some clients that may be interested in expanding a Wyoming position.

Let me know how you would like to proceed.

Thank you for giving Mastio & Company the opportunity to discuss our market
research capabilities for customer satisfaction and benchmarking.

Mastio & Company would like to have the privilege of building a relationship
with you and assisting your efforts in maximizing customer satisfaction and
delight.  We believe that meeting customer needs, and exceeding expectations
is not only one of the most important business processes, but also builds
loyalty and increases profits.

We would be delighted to have you subscribe to the 2001 multi-client Natural
Gas Marketer Customer Satisfaction Study.
The main benefit of Mastio's multi-client report is, not only will you be
able to discover what customers think of you on 30+ customer service
attributes, you will also learn what customers think of 45+ other gas
marketers, as well.  This study will be an excellent tool if you want to
maximize & improve customer satisfaction, measure & plot progress for
improving customer service, benchmark yourself against competitors, retain &
find new customers and build customer loyalty.
Mastio & Company is convinced you would reap substantial benefits by
discovering your perceived level of customer satisfaction.  As in other
highly competitive industries, natural gas marketers are discovering that
ignoring customer dissatisfaction can be a crucial mistake. The bottom line
is, superior customer service is a given these days, not a difference.
Customers now take superior customer service for granted. Customers are
raising their expectations. Leading companies are responding to this trend
by instituting customer service initiatives and measuring their progress,
versus customer needs and their competition.
Customer satisfaction matters with winning companies, especially for
companies interested in profitable growth.  These leading companies have
actually moved customer satisfaction from a slogan to reality.  They have
made a commitment to value and are realizing superior growth and
profitability because their business strategies focus on enhancing the value
of what they offer customers.
I would like to further point out that our report comes with an electronic
version.  The electronic version allows the segmentation of all the
respondents by state, volume, and customer-type, switching status, head to
head comparisons with competitors, etc. The software can be installed on
your network and up to 50 people can query the software at the same time.
The biggest advantage is the custom tagging feature.  This feature allows
the grouping of your customers, for example, by the key person responsible
for interaction, customer service teams by name, territory, profitability,
strategic importance, etc.  The options are unlimited.  This powerful tool
will empower people to do additional analysis on their own.  They will take
ownership, because the analysis of the data is personalized.

In closing, Mastio & Company would welcome the opportunity to deliver you
actionable information when you are ready.

Sincerely,
MASTIO & COMPANY

The next meeting of the Wyoming Energy Commission is on November 12-13 in Evanston and a meeting in Spokane on the 15th, leaving the 14th open.

Subject:	Buffalo Power Company LLC - Gas Turbine Power Plant Project 

ENA and Crestone (Northern Border's non-regulated affiliate) met with a group of developers and Joe Meyer, Secretary of State in Wyoming, who have proposed to build a 200 MW power plant (expandable to 500 MW) in the Powder River basin of Wyoming.  Their ""angle"" is that the existing utility, Powder River Electric Coop, cannot meet the demand for electricity and the necessary distribution infrastructure to maintain the pace of development in the Coal Bed Methane BOOM that is happening in the basin.  

As you may or may not know, Enron has been very involved in this Coal Bed Methane play since 1998.  ENA is the largest purchaser of 3rd party gas in the basin and Crestone is the largest non-producer gathering company in the basin.  Crestone has a gathering trunkline located near their proposed site.  The developers will be filing a petition to remove this area from the COOP's certificated territory in the next couple of weeks.

There are obviously regulatory issues revolving around their ability to gain access to this ""retail"" market and the project would not be economically feasible as a merchant plant in the wholesale market.  However, they seem to have some political backing.

These developers recognize that they need Enron's assistance in developing this project on three main fronts:

1.  Power Marketing and Project development
2.  Gas Supplies and Pipeline access
3.  Regulatory and Transmission expertise

Given the fact that Joe Meyer is the early favorite to be the next Wyoming Governor and we are trying to work well with the State of Wyoming, and we have a natural competitive advantage in this market from a gas supply and pipeline perspective, I would like to pursue this opportunity a little further.

Therefore, I am wondering if I could get a Sr. Commercial Power Representative and a Regulatory Representative (Steve Walton would be good since he will be on the Wyoming Energy Commission), to attend a meeting in Denver with myself and the Crestone representatives sometime in the next 2 weeks.

Please give me a call and I can elaborate on the opportunity or answer your questions.  I don't want to make this email a novel!

Thanks a lot.

Dear West,

We talked briefly on Monday about our commitment to a full work day at Enron.  If you are in the office, then please be prepared to contribute to the group for a full day.  Our schedule now calls for critical communication in the afternoons.  We need to know that each employee will be here every day to create the consistency needed to outperform the rest of the market.  

We want to remain as flexible as possible with all traders when it comes to an emergency, but remember that you have a commitment to Enron to contribute a full work day.  

Please organize your vacation on the west desk calendar with Ina and coordinate any early afternoon departures with Ina and myself.  Also, prepare to have your markets covered when you leave the office early.

Sincerely,

As I have discussed with you, Citizens is concerned about the frequency of upstream supply issues that have resulted in the recent cuts in the deliveries to the Griffith power plant.  Based on the information I have received, the reasons for these cuts have not risen to the level of Force Majeure, which as you know is the only event that would excuse performance under our contract for firm delivery of gas.  Citizens therefore requests that Enron respond to Citizens in writing with a descriptions of the steps Enron is taking to insure that there is not a continuation of these contract performance issues into the future. Your prompt attention to this matter is appreciated.  "

My email probably was a bit out of line, sent out of frustration - my apologies.  It was not wise of me to give a trader a heads up on my intent to buy in the first place, going forward I will not do that.  I have no expectation of having Stephan manage anyone's price risk.  I am hoping to develop Cascade into a long-term Enron customer, I make no origination on the deals I have done with them, I have encouraged them to enter into longer term DI deals and I have hooked them up with EOL - all intended to benefit of the cash desk in Calgary.  Next time the market falls $0.12 immediately following a trade I make on behalf of a customer I'll keep my mouth (email) shut.

There is no offence intended by either of these emails and I intend to continue to try and develop more spot and term business for your desk.

Dave

Dave,

I just wanted to touch base with you on the cash trade that you intermediated between Stephane and Cascade this morning. I don't really feel that it is Stephane's responsibility to manage Cascades price risk and I think that you are out of line for accusing him of running over your customer. If you would like we could look at doing an  MSA with Cascade where by we could sell them gas at Sumas DI.

The laundry list of topics discussed is attached.  We expressed the sentiment that the root cause of all these issues and concerns is the current composition (and non-independence) of the ISO board, and suggested that the ISO board situation should be the subject of the upcoming FERC audit of ISO.  We went on to discuss the audit further and the fact that there is no established or formal comment process.  However, we were invited to file written comments with the Commission on what we thought should be audited, and Alan is taking the lead on this.  We will try to get others to sign on to the comments.  Some of the discussion items that the staff was highly interested in included:

	ISO request for a bid from us to prop up the price (staff requested a copy of the transcript).
	Any unexplained decreases in ATC (staff asked to be advised in real time).
	Information related to ISO OOM purchases (and whether they were declining).

All in all, it was a successful, informal call lasting about 40 minutes.  Staff was receptive to and agreed to receive periodic calls from us in the future.  This allows them to keep up with what is going on industry, and of course gives us an opportunity to educate and alert them on issues of interest to us.  Ray

04:33 20Nov2001 RSF-Platt's: Enron sees cash drain, warns on survival

New York (Platts)--20Nov2001/533 am EST/1033 GMT Enron filed Q3 financials late Monday, revealing a huge cash drain, despite last week's $1.5-bil asset-backed infusion from merger partner Dynegy. Enron said its cash Friday had fallen to $1.2-bil, even with the Dynegy payment three days earlier, $550-mil drawn on a new bank line last week and $3-bil drawn on existing lines earlier this month to pay off $1.9-bil of commercial paper. Enron blamed operating costs, trade settlements and collateral deposits paid to trading partners. Enron said it expects $800-mil soon from asset sales and got another $440-mil bank line Monday. But it warned it might not be enough to keep its investment-grade credit rating or restructure debt coming due. That could have a ""material adverse impact on Enron's ability to continue as a going concern,"" it warned.

19:23 19Nov2001 RSF-Enron sounds debt alarm, reduces reported earnings

    By C. Bryson Hull
    HOUSTON, Nov 19 (Reuters) - Humbled energy giant Enron Corp. <ENE.N> on Monday warned that it could be forced to pay a $690 million debt by next week and reduced its already-abysmal third-quarter earnings.
    The Houston company sounded the debt and credit alarms once again in a filing made on Monday with U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
    Among the new information included is the disclosure that Enron is up against a short deadline to meet a $690 million debt obligation triggered by a credit downgrade last week.   That marked the start of a nine-day period that expires on Nov. 26, during which Enron must lay down collateral against the debt owed to a third party in one of its myriad partnerships.
    If not, the partner has the right to liquidate all of the assets of the partnership, which includes a Brazilian natural gas company that Enron was counting on selling to raise $250 million in cash.
    The company is working to make alternative payment arrangements, since it can ill-afford to pay the debt now. Enron has already already maxed out its $3 billion credit line, secured roughly $2 billion in loans and is looking for more cash to stay afloat.
    Enron also reduced previously reported 2001 third-quarter earnings by 3 cents per share and increased previously reported earnings for the first 9 months of the year by a penny per share. The move reflects adjustments made after the quarter's end, Enron said.
    On Oct. 16, Enron reported a loss of $638 million or 84 cents per share for the third quarter of 2001. On Nov 8, Enron said it had restated earnings for 1997-2000 and that net income for the four-year period was more than a half a billion lower than originally reported.
    It also warned that a further drop in its credit rating could force it to pay $3.9 billion to other partnerships, the bulk of it to Osprey Trust and Marlin Water Trust.
    Such an outcome would keep Enron from paying its revolving credit accounts and ""would likely have a material adverse impact on Enron's ability to continue as a going concern,"" the company wrote.
    Enron had released those figures earlier, but had yet to state in such stark terms the dire risk the debts pose to its viability.
    CREDIT COULD BE A KILLER
    Moody's Investors Service and Standard & Poor's this month cut their respective senior unsecured debt ratings for Enron to ""Baa3"" and ""BBB-minus,"" just one notch above ""junk"" status. Each warned it may cut its respective ratings again. Moody's also cut Enron's short-term debt rating, which affects  commercial paper, to ""Not Prime,"" a junk rating.
    In nearly all of its partnership deals, Enron guaranteed the financing it received with a promise to issue Enron shares to its partners if its credit fell below investment grade and its stock price was under certain levels. At the close of trading Monday on the New York Stock Exchange, Enron shares were at $9.06 - well below the trigger prices.
    All of the partnerships, which Enron used to finance projects in a way that kept them off the balance sheet, have become the once-proud company's bane. The SEC is investigating potential conflict-of-interest issues involving two such partnerships on which ousted Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow served as general partner.
    Enron had to extract itself from those partnerships, which led to a $1.2 billion reduction in Enron shareholder equity.
    The revelation of the equity reduction started one of the more stunning and rapid corporate collapses in recent memory, leaving Enron to be bought on Nov. 9 by smaller cross-town rival Dynegy Inc. <DYN.N> for the fire-sale price of $9 billion in stock.
    In an unusual note, Enron said that its financial statements in the filing were not audited by an independent accountant, per SEC regulations, because of ""the need of Arthur Andersen LLP, Enron's independent auditors, to complete their review procedures.""
    Arthur Andersen had no comment, but Enron said the ongoing investigation by a special committee appointed by Enron's board of directors to look into its partnership dealings precludes the audit's completion.

--------------------------



Less than a year ago, the Houston-based energy behemoth had everything: money, power, glitz, smarts, new ideas, and a CEO who wanted to make it the most important company in the world. Now its stock is down, wall street is bearish, and the CEO is gone. What went wrong?
by Mimi Swartz </mag/issues/authors/mimiswartz.php>
THE ENRON SKYSCRAPER NEAR THE SOUTH END OF HOUSTON'S DOWNTOWN feels like the international headquarters of the best and the brightest. The lobby in no way resembles the hushed, understated entryways of the old-fashioned oil companies, like Shell and Texaco nearby. Enron, in contrast, throbs with modernity. The people hustling in and out of the elevators are black, white, brown; Asian, Middle Eastern, European, African, as well as American-born. They are young, mostly under 35, and dressed in the aggressively casual uniform of the tech industry-the guys wear khakis, polo shirts, and Banana Republic button-downs. Almost preposterously fit, they move through the building intently, like winners. Enron is nothing if not energetic: A Big Brother-size TV screen frantically reports on the stock market near a bank of elevators, while another hefty black television relaying the same news greets people entering from the garage. A sculpture of the corporate symbol, an E tipped at a jaunty angle, radiates colors as it spins frenetically on its axis; a Starbucks concession on the ground floor keeps everyone properly caffeinated. Multicolored, inspirational flags hang from the ceiling, congratulating Enron on its diversity and its values; one more giant banner between elevator banks declares Enron's simple if grandiose goal: ""From the World's Leading Energy Company to . . . The World's Leading Company!""
For a while, that future seemed guaranteed, as Enron transformed itself from a stodgy, troubled pipeline company in 1985 to a trading colossus in 2000. It was a Wall Street darling, with a stock price that increased 1,700 percent in that sixteen-year period, with revenues that increased from $40 billion to $100 billion. ""The very mention of the company in energy circles throughout the world creates reactions ranging from paralyzing fear to envy,"" notes a 2001 report from Global Change Associates, a firm that provides market intelligence to the energy business.
This Enron was largely the creation of Jeff Skilling, a visionary determined to transform American business. Hired sixteen years ago as a consultant by then-CEO Ken Lay, Skilling helped build a company that disdained the old formula of finding energy in the ground, hauling it in pipelines, and then selling it to refineries and other customers. Instead, it evolved into a company that could trade and market energy in all its forms, from natural gas to electricity, from wind to water. If you had a risky drilling venture, Enron would fund it for a piece of the action. If you wanted your megacorporation's energy needs analyzed and streamlined, Enron could do the job. If you were a Third World country with a pitiful infrastructure and burgeoning power needs, Enron was there to build and build. Basically, if an idea was new and potentially-and fantastically-lucrative, Enron wanted the first crack. And with each success, Enron became ever more certain of its destiny. The company would be the bridge between the old economy and the high-tech world, and in February of this year, Skilling reaped his reward when he succeeded Lay as chief executive officer. Enron, says Skilling, ""was a great marriage of the risk-taking mentality of the oil patch with the risk-taking mentality of the financial markets.""
The Enron story reflects the culture that drove American business at the end of the twentieth century. Like the high-tech companies it emulated, Enron was going to reinvent the American business model and, in turn, the American economy. Maybe it was natural that this Brave New World also produced a culture that was based on absolutes: not just the old versus the new, but the best versus the mediocre, the risk takers versus the complacent-those who could see the future versus those who could not. The key was investing in the right kind of intellectual capital. With the best and the brightest, a company couldn't possibly go wrong.
Or could it? Today Enron's stock trades at around $35, down from a high of $80 in January. The press cast Enron as the archvillain of California's energy crisis last spring, and Skilling caught a blueberry pie in the face for his relentless defense of the free market. A long-troubled power plant project in India threatened the company's global ambitions. Telecommunications, in which Enron was heavily invested, imploded. Wall Street analysts who once touted the company questioned its accounting practices. Some of the change in Enron's fortunes can be attributed to the economic downturn in uncertain times that has afflicted all of American business. But the culture that the company created and lived by cannot escape blame.
ENRON, JEFF SKILLING SAYS, HAD ""a totally different way of thinking about business-we got it."" At Enron, in fact, you either ""got it"" or you were gone-it was as simple as black and white. It is not coincidental, then, that the color scheme of Skilling's River Oaks mansion mirrors the corporation he once headed. Here, the living room's white walls shimmer against the mahogany floors. Black leather trims the edge of snowy carpets. Billowy sofas set off the jet-black baby grand. In the entry, white orchids cascade from a black vase on a black pedestal table that in turn pools onto cold, white marble. There is only one off-color note: After almost twenty years, Jeff Skilling is no longer associated with Enron, having resigned abruptly after just six months as CEO. Once, Skilling was hailed as the next Jack Welch (General Electric's masterful CEO), as one of Worth magazine's best CEO's in America (anointed in 2001), and even as a daredevil who hosted the kind of unchained adventure junkets in which, a friend told BusinessWeek, ""someone could actually get killed."" Today, he sounds more like Ebenezer Scrooge on Christmas morning. ""I had no idea what I'd let go of,"" Skilling says of all the personal sacrifices he made while retooling Enron. 
From a black chair in the white library, across from a huge black and white photograph of his daughter and two sons, Skilling clarifies. The demands of working 24-7 for Enron caused him to ignore his personal finances. Divorced, he lived in a 2,200-square-foot house without a microwave or a dishwasher. He almost missed his brother's wedding. ""Learning a foreign language-I never learned a foreign language!"" he exclaims. He never once took his youngest son to school. ""I'm interested in the kids. You don't do kids in fifteen-minute scheduling."" Travel: ""You can't go to Africa for a week and get anything out of it!"" Skilling includes the study of architecture and design on his list of missed opportunities, then he stops and sighs. ""I'm not sure that fulfillment in life is compatible with a CEO's job,"" he says, finally. Then his eyes lock on mine, and his voice, which had softened, regains its pragmatic edge. ""It would have been easy to stay,"" he says. ""But that would not have been good for me."" 
He's a smallish, ruddy-faced man who keeps himself at fighting weight, handsome in the way of corporate titans, with piercing cheekbones and that assiduously stolid gaze. But the impatience Skilling once reserved for cautious underlings and dull-witted utility company executives is now targeted at reporters who have labeled his resignation ""bizarre"" and associates who are bitterly skeptical of his need for family time. His shrug stretches the limits of his shimmering blue button-down, and his matching blue eyes look put upon. ""I'm surprised,"" he says, ""that people have so much trouble understanding this.""
PEOPLE WHO PASSED THROUGH DOWNTOWN HOUSTON in the late eighties or early nineties couldn't help but notice a funny and, for its time, novel scene unfolding throughout the workday at the base of the Enron Building. From nine to five and before and after, you could see people slipping out of the pristine silver skyscraper to smoke. They perched on the chrome banisters or lurked near the glass doors at the entry, puffing like mad. They always looked hurried and furtive, even ashamed. Whatever people knew about Enron in those days (and most people didn't know much), it was often associated with that scene: Enron boasted one of the first nonsmoking corporate headquarters in Houston, and there couldn't have been clearer evidence of its break with the energy world of the past. What macho engineer would have put up with such humiliation?
But this company was a child of another time, that period in the mid-eighties when chaos enveloped the gas business. Federal deregulation of natural gas turned a steady, secure industry, in which gas pipeline companies frequently enjoyed a monopoly in portions of the areas that they served, into a volatile free-for-all. The situation was compounded five years later by federal deregulation of the pipeline business. So it happened that a gentlemanly gas pipeline company, Houston Natural Gas (HNG) found itself under attack from Coastal Corporation, Oscar Wyatt's less than gentlemanly firm. HNG was then run by Lay, a sturdy, taciturn former economics professor and Transco chief operating officer who had a passion for military strategy. (His doctoral thesis at the University of Houston was on supply and demand in the Vietnam War.) Lay, who was from Missouri and never succumbed-at least outwardly-to Texas brashness, had done well enough: Thanks to canny expansions, HNG's pipelines stretched from Florida to California and throughout the state of Texas.
HNG fended off Coastal, but to protect the company from other takeover attempts, Lay nimbly engineered the sale of HNG in 1985 to a friendly Nebraska pipeline concern called InterNorth, one of the largest pipeline companies in the country at the time. Then, a funny thing happened: HNG started acting in a way that would characterize the company for years to come-a lot like Coastal. What the Nebraskans blithely labeled ""the purchase"" was being called ""the merger"" back in Houston, and before long, following some particularly brutal politicking between Omaha and Houston, the company's center of gravity started shifting toward Texas, and shortly after that, Ken Lay was running a new company called Enron. ""Over time it became clear that Lay had a better vision of the future,"" says one person associated with Enron at that time. ""He never fought change. He embraced change.""
Lay had won, but what exactly did that mean? Enron was saddled with massive debt from the takeover attempt, and thanks to deregulation, no longer had exclusive use of its pipelines. Without new ideas-for that matter, a whole new business plan-the company could be finished before it really even got started. 
LIKE MANY PEOPLE WHO TEAMED UP WITH ENRON IN THE EIGHTIES, Jeff Skilling had spent a lot of time in the Midwest, and he was self-made-at fourteen he had been the chief production director at a start-up TV station in Aurora, Illinois. (His mother would drop him off there every day after school.) ""I liked being successful when I was working, and I was smart,"" he told BusinessWeek earlier this year. But unlike many of his Enron colleagues, Skilling wasn't deliberate and soft-spoken and happy to go home at five o'clock; he was anxious and excitable, and nothing, but nothing excited him more than what he would come to call ""intellectual capital."" He loved being smart, and he loved being surrounded by smart people. He graduated from Southern Methodist University, went into banking-assets and liability management-and took on Harvard Business School, where he graduated in the top 5 percent of his class. Then Skilling took the next step on what was then the new, souped-up path to American success: He joined Manhattan's McKinsey and Company as a business consultant, and that is where Ken Lay found him in 1985. 
It is often said of Lay that his instincts for hiring the best are flawless, and his choice of Skilling probably saved the company. Skilling was above all an expert at markets and how they worked. While everyone else was worrying about the gluts and the shortages that defined the gas industry, he alone saw the parallels between gas and other businesses. And so in a world where credit was nearly impossible to come by, Skilling came up with what he called the Gas Bank, which contractually guaranteed both the supply and the price of gas to a network of suppliers and consumers. Enron would not be a broker but a banker. It would buy and sell the gas itself and assume the risk involved. And Enron would make money on transactions, much like an investment bank would.
Skilling worked up some numbers and found them ""absolutely compelling."" Then the McKinsey consultant took the idea to a meeting of about 25 Enron executives. He had a one-page presentation. ""Almost to a person,"" Skilling says, ""they thought it was stupid."" Almost. After Skilling left the meeting dejected, he walked Ken Lay to an elevator and apologized. Lay listened and then said, ""Let's go.""
The Gas Bank was not an overnight success. For months Skilling woke up in a cold sweat, sure he had ruined not only his career but the careers of dozens of colleagues who had assisted him. In fact, he had come upon one of those divides that seem to define his life: ""I believed this whole world would be different, a huge breakthrough"" is the way Skilling puts it today, and even if he is typically immodest, he was right. Fairly soon after launching, the company sold $800 million worth of gas in a week. True to Skilling's character, success turned out to be a matter of old versus new: He says the joke around Enron was that if a company's CEO was under fifty, ""We were in."" And he was in too: In 1990 Skilling finally left McKinsey and joined Enron as the head of Enron Finance Corporation, a new division created just for him. In 1991 that company closed a deal that earned $11 million in profit. After that, says Skilling, ""we never looked back.""
Skilling and Lay also realized that the Gas Bank couldn't work unless it had a trading component. Myriad trades were needed to build the market that would make the project go. But by buying and selling enormous quantities of gas, Enron not only constructed a market but almost instantly came to dominate it. The company had the best contacts, the best intelligence, and the best access to supplies. That, in turn, attracted more customers who wanted to be part of the play. With so many customers in its pocket, Enron could better predict the direction of the market and could use that knowledge to make trades for its own benefit-Enron could in effect bet on which way the price of gas would go, as one might do with pork bellies or soybeans, but with startling accuracy, thereby generating profits higher than anyone could have ever imagined.
THIS CHANGE COULD NEVER HAVE OCCURRED without another change Skilling had made: He created, within Enron, a new culture to match its new trading business. The idea was to build a ""knowledge-based business,"" which demanded a skill set not exactly prized by Enron's employees from the old HNG days. Most were deliberate, cautious, responsible, somewhat defensive people, most of them men, of course-the kind of people you'd expect to find working in an industry regulated by the federal government. But now the company needed bolder people for its bold new era: that included anyone who wanted to make money-lots of money-for themselves and for the company. ""Enron was going to create a niche for itself or die,"" one former executive explains. ""The people who had narrow views eventually were forced out, because if they had narrow views about other things, they had narrow views about the market.""
Skilling wanted smart people but not just any smart people. He wanted the smartest people from schools like Harvard, Stanford, and maybe, Rice. And because his firm was now acting more like a bank than a pipeline company, he wanted to draw from the pool of recruits that would be attracted to the biggest and best investment banks, like Merrill Lynch or Credit Suisse First Boston. In addition to being smart, Enron people were also supposed to be ""aggressive."" You were right for Enron if you didn't want to wait until you were thirty to close your own deals or move up in an organization. 
You could see what he was looking for on ""Super Saturdays"" at the Houston headquarters: eight fifty-minute interviews with ten minute breaks in between-the company might herd as many as four hundred people through in just one day. They were scored from 1 to 5 on their smarts, their problem-solving ability, their passion for hard work, and what at Enron was called ""a sense of urgency."" People who scored less than 2.5 were scratched. The shrewdest candidates knew how to work Enron before they were even hired: These were the types that automatically turned down the company's first offer, knowing Enron would come back with more. The starting salary was around $80,000. Maybe it wasn't a fortune-yet-but the signing bonus, about $20,000, was more than enough for a lease on the obligatory Porsche Boxster or one of the lofts being renovated close to downtown. (Enron people didn't live in far-flung suburbs. Suburbs were uncool and too far from the office.)
For the lucky winners, Enron offered the corporate equivalent of a gifted-and-talented program. New associates learned the latest techniques for structuring energy deals, and there were rotations at Enron offices around the globe. The hours were long, but every possible need was taken care of. A company concierge handled all the things important people couldn't be bothered with: picking up dry cleaning or prescriptions, shining shoes, cleaning the house, planning a vacation. Of course, a lot of people who worked for Enron never got to take vacations-they were too busy making money-but they could use the company gym and the company's personal trainers. If they were overweight or wanted to quit smoking, they could join Enron's Wellness Program. Massages were offered six days a week, from seven in the morning until ten at night. ""They were so cutting edge,"" rhapsodizes someone involved with the company health care program at the time. ""They really thought about the psychology and what it took to keep these people going.""
Skilling handed out titles analogous to those at Wall Street firms-analysts, associates, directors, and managing directors-but everyone knew that those titles didn't really matter. Money did. Instead of competitive salaries and decent bonuses, Enron offered competitive salaries and merit-based bonuses-with no cap. ""If you really worked hard and delivered results, you could make a lot of money,"" says Ken Rice, who stayed with Enron for 21 years until resigning recently as the head of the company's faltering broadband division. Or, as the saying goes, you got to eat what you killed. Gas traders with two or three years of experience could wind up with a $1 million bonus. And the more you produced, the closer you got to Jeff: Real hot dogs joined him glacier hiking in Patagonia, Land Cruiser racing in Australia, or off-road motorcycling in a re-creation of the Baja 1,000 race, ending at a spectacular Mexican villa. ""Every time he'd speak, I'd believe everything he'd say,"" one loyalist says. 
And why not? By 1995 Enron had become North America's largest natural-gas merchant, controlling 20 percent of the market. But at a company where the buzzword was ""aggressive,"" that was no place to stop: Skilling and Lay believed the Gas Bank model could easily be applied to the electricity business. Firmly committed to the notion that a deregulated market meant better service at lower prices for consumers (and untold profits for Enron), they began barnstorming the country, pressing their case with entrenched power company presidents (who, with their multimillion-dollar salaries and monopoly service areas, had little incentive to change) and energy regulators (who were somewhat more receptive, thanks in part to Enron's generous lobbying efforts).
But the biggest winner of all was probably Jeff Skilling. In 1997 Ken Lay made him the president and chief operating officer of the company. By then, the division known as Enron Capital and Trade Resources was the nations largest wholesale buyer and seller of natural gas and electricity. The division had grown from two hundred to two thousand employees, and revenues from $2 billion to $7 billion. ""Mr. Skilling's experience so far with the turmoil in the industry has convinced him that he is on the right track,"" the New York Times noted. Everyone would certainly have thought so: Enron and Skilling had totally transformed one industry and were well on their way to transforming another.
""FIRING UP AN IDEA MACHINE; Enron Is Encouraging the Entrepreneurs Within,"" sang the New York Times in 1999. ""In the staid world of regulated utilities and energy companies, Enron Corp is that gate-crashing Elvis,"" crowed Fortune in 2000. Wall Street was demanding tech-size growth on a tech timetable, and Enron, in 2000, obliged with second quarter earnings of $289 million, up 30 percent from the previous year. That year the company seemed to discover a market a minute: Under Skilling, Enron was trading coal, paper, steel, and even weather. No one blinked when a London wine bar became an Enron client. People drank more in warm weather than cold, so why not buy a hedge against the usual winter downturn?
But most exciting to the financial world was Enron's entry into high-tech communications. Because of the company's marketing dominance, EnronOnline became another overnight success, handling $335 billion in commodity trades online in 2000. Enron, as usual, made its money on the spread between the bid price and the asking price. Then there was the broadband business: To Enron, trading excess capacity in large, high-speed fiber-optic networks (empty lanes on the fabled information highway) wasn't that different from trading the capacity of natural gas pipelines. So Enron created a market for what the industry calls bandwidth. Soon after, it also announced a twenty-year deal with Blockbuster to deliver movies on demand electronically to people in their homes. Enron looked like a company that couldn't lose. ""Its strategy of building businesses, shedding hard assets, and trading various commodities can help it do well even in an uncertain market,"" BusinessWeek insisted.
There was, however, another reason Enron did so well in such a short time: the company's hard-nosed approach toward its customers. The old notion of customer service was based on the long haul-you had to nurse and coddle customers to keep them. But Enron had new markets and new ideas-customers had to come to it. Over time, the company stopping referring to its business clients as customers and began calling them ""counterparties.""
Skilling wanted the biggest profits on the shortest timetable: Gains were maximized by creating, owning, and then abandoning a market before it became overtaxed and overregulated. So if you wanted to launch a high-risk venture quickly-such as Zilkha Energy's new high-tech approach to drilling for oil-you got your financing from Enron because a bank would take forever to underwrite the project, if it ever would. But because Enron invented its markets and subsequently dominated them, Enron could set the terms of its deals, from the timeline to the method of accounting to whether the deal happened at all. 
While many businesses used what was known in the industry as ""mark-to-market accounting,"" for instance, Enron used it on an unprecedented scale. The company priced their deals at current market value-but it was always Enron's idea of the market value; companies that balked at their pricing didn't get deals. And while old-fashioned companies spread their profits out like annuities over a period of years, Enron took most of its profit up-front. However many millions would be made on a deal that covered several years, they went on the books in the current year. If a few analysts thought there might be something fishy about what they called ""subjective accounting,"" investors didn't particularly care as long as the profits rolled in. As the market fluctuated and the landscape changed, the company might abandon a project that had been in the works for months because its profit margins weren't going to be high enough. ""Enron is known for leaving people at the altar,"" says one former employee. Winning the highest possible profits for the company could even extend to Enron's attitude toward charity. When a fundraiser for the Houston READ Commission, a literacy group, called on Enron for a contribution, it was suggested that he start raising money for Enron's competing literacy charity: ""Even the person who was supposed to give money away for Enron was supposed to make money for Enron,"" he says.
As Enron became more and more successful, the culture Skilling had created took on a dark side: The competition turned inward. As one member of the Enron family put it, ""It became a company full of mercenaries."" The change started at the bottom. As Enron's domination of the energy market grew, most of the recruiting frills fell away. New associates were treated much like the commodities the company traded. Global Change's Enron spies reported overhearing orders like ""I need a smart person-go buy me one"" or ""Buy me an intelligent slave, quick."" Enron had never been the kind of place where people sang to you on your birthday, but now the workaholism bordered on self-parody: A Random Acts of Kindness program lasted only a few months. It was too disruptive. People couldn't get their work done.
And, of course, Enron had a program for institutionalizing creative tension. The Performance Review Committee, which had initially been installed by Skilling in the Capital group, became known as the harshest forced ranking system in the country. Employees were rated on a scale of one to five, and those with fives were usually gone within six months. (The PRC's nickname quickly became ""rank and yank."") It was a point of pride that Skilling's division replaced 15 percent of its workforce every year. As one Skilling associate put it, ""Jeff viewed this like turning over the inventory in a grocery store."" Skilling's approach to business-get in and get out-had become Enron's attitude toward its workers. In time, it would become many workers' attitude toward the company. Teamwork, never that valuable in a trading culture, went the way of the eyeshade and the abacus. If protocol required an Enron higher-up to come from Europe to help with a project in the Third World, he might help-or he might not, depending on whether another, potentially more lucrative project was pending elsewhere.
Everyone felt the pressure to perform on a massive scale at massive speed: ""They were so goal oriented toward immediate gratification that they lost sight of the future,"" says one former employee. Anyone who couldn't close deals within a quarter was punished with bad PRC scores, as were the higher-ups who had backed them. Past errors and old grudges were dredged up so often as new ammunition in PRC meetings that the phrase ""No old tapes"" became an Enron clich?. ""People went from being geniuses to idiots overnight,"" says one former Enron executive.
In such a hothouse, paranoia flowered. New contracts contained highly restrictive confidentiality agreements about anything pertaining to the company. E-mail was monitored. A former executive routinely carried two laptops, one for the company and one for himself. People may have been rich at Enron, but they weren't necessarily happy. One recruiter described the culture this way: ""They roll you over and slit your throat and watch your eyes while you bleed to death.""
BEFORE JEFF SKILLING COULD TRANSFORM ENRON from the world's leading energy company into the world's leading company, he had to make one more change: Just as he had done ten years before, Skilling had to purge the company of its remaining old order. Where Enron once prized cautious executives who dealt with tangible assets like pipelines, it now valued bold executives who dealt with intangible assets. Pipelines, power plants-they may have been Enron's pride, but Skilling wanted them gone. Expensive, long-term building projects had no place when Wall Street was devoted to quick profits and enormous returns on investment capital, and Skilling knew it. ""It wasn't the time for long-term approaches,"" an Enron executive says of Wall Street's mood. ""It was the technology era.""
To rid Enron of the last vestiges of its past, Skilling had to take on Rebecca Mark, long considered his rival for the CEO's job. Mark was for many years the poster child for the Enron way: Young, attractive, aggressive-her nickname was Mark the Shark-she came from sturdy Midwestern stock but had the requisite Harvard MBA. Mark was largely responsible for the success of Enron International, the asset-heavy side of the company where she developed $20 billion worth of gas and power plants, which accounted for 40 percent of Enron's profits in 1998. For this she reaped breathtaking compensation-one Enron executive estimated $10 million-and adoring press clips, including two appearances on Fortune's list of the fifty most powerful women in corporate America.
But then Mark ran into trouble with a gas-fired power plant in Dabhol, India, one of the largest ever constructed. She had played the game the Enron way: Taking Enron into a new market, she had finagled low import taxes (20 percent instead of the usual 53) and hung in through 24 lawsuits and three changes in government. But the time and expense needed to make India and other Enron plants around the globe successful did not mesh with Enron's goals, and Skilling's impatience with Mark grew.
Forcing Mark out, however, was no easy matter. Key executives left, divisions were dismantled, but she remained. The truth was Enron didn't mind firing lower-level employees, but it hated to fire the kind of aggressive, relentless people it tended to promote. The company preferred humiliation-keeping a director in his cubicle, say, but failing to include him in the glamour deals, or kicking someone upstairs with a fancy title. (One particularly difficult executive won a few years at graduate school, gratis.) A company as smart as Enron could probably deduce too that dispatching one of the most visible businesswomen in the country would provoke a public-relations disaster. So Lay and Skilling did something classically Enronian: They gave Mark her own company. Despite Skilling's contempt for asset-heavy businesses, Enron spent more than $2 billion to buy a run-of-the-mill British water utility that could serve as Enron's entry into the emerging world of water privatization. Mark was put in charge of making Enron, yes, the world's greatest water company. Azurix, as the new business was called, looked like another sure thing: Its IPO in 1999 raised $695 million. 
But Mark had to succeed on Enron's increasingly abbreviated timetable in a business fraught with political and emotional complexities. Water is not like gas or electricity-owners and governments are a lot less willing to give it up, even for lots of money. The company stumbled, layoffs commenced, and confidence evaporated. By August 2000 the stock price, which had started out at $19, had fallen to $5. Mark's resignation followed, and Azurix, much diminished, was folded into Enron. ""I think it's best for Rebecca to start afresh,"" Lay, who had been a mentor to Mark, told the Wall Street Journal. Or as one critic put it, ""They were more interested in destroying the old culture than running a business."" 
As 2000 drew to a close, Skilling was in total command. In December Ken Lay announced the inevitable: ""The best time for the succession to occur is when the company is doing well,"" he told the press. ""Enron is doing extremely well now."" In February 2001 Jeff Skilling took over the CEO's job.
ALMOST IMMEDIATELY THE TROUBLE STARTED. Enron's domination of the electric-power market made it an instant target in the California deregulation debacle. Both PBS's Frontline and the New York Times took on Enron, portraying the company as a heartless colossus that used its influence in Washington (Lay and Enron's political action committee are the top contributors to George W. Bush) to force old people on fixed incomes to choose between buying food or electricity. Skilling and Lay appeared on camera singing belligerent anthems to the free market, while another memorable scene juxtaposed one of the company's jackallike traders against a hapless state employee in California, as both tried to buy power online. The Times reported that Lay had tried to persuade a new federal commissioner to change his views on energy deregulation. The bad press was, to say the least, ironic: Just as the media was pounding Enron for its omnipotence, Wall Street was discovering its weaknesses. By late March the stock price had slid to $50 a share from $80 in January.
Within Enron, the asset-based divisions took the rap for the decline. (The India plant continued to be enormously costly, at least in part because of constant turnover within Enron's management team.) But the California situation was more visible and therefore more damaging, despite Enron's claim that the state had never built enough power plants to service its population and never properly managed those it had. ""For three months Gray Davis did a very good job of blaming us,"" says Mark Palmer, a vice president for corporate communications. ""We were a Texas company. There was a Texan in the White House. California was a state that didn't put him in office, and his biggest contributor was a Texas energy company. Performance is going to take care of our stock price. The truth will take care of Gray Davis."" (California utilities still owe Enron $500 million, another reason stockholders might be panicky.) But more problematic than the crisis itself was Skilling's all too apparent lack of contrition. Facing down his critics, he cracked a joke comparing California with the Titanic. (""At least the Titanic went down with its lights on."")
But the biggest problem was Enron's telecommunications division, which had been responsible for at least one third of its heady stock price. Investors believed that Enron could revolutionize high-speed communications, just as it had revolutionized gas and power. Enron estimated the global market for buying and selling space over fiber-optic cable would grow from $155 billion in 2001 to $383 billion by 2004-but then the tech bubble burst. So too did the much-hyped movies-on-demand deal with Blockbuster. For the first time in its confoundingly successful life, Enron had nothing new to take to market. Like the popular high school girl who suddenly packs on a few pounds, Enron suddenly looked less alluring to Wall Street.
Skilling launched a campaign to keep Enron's most important cheerleaders, the stock analysts, in the tent, but he wasn't cut out to be a supplicant. During the reporting of first quarter profits, he called an analyst who challenged Enron's financial reporting an ""asshole."" When the company reported hefty second quarter profits, many analysts questioned whether those profits had come from the generation of new business or from the sale of old assets. Ignoring the growing chorus critical of Enron's accounting, Skilling promised, as he always had, that innovations were just around the corner. ""There wasn't any positive news,"" Carol Coale, of Prudential Financial, says now. ""Basically, he talked me out of a downgrade.""
The business press, so generous in the past, turned surly. Fortune had asked in March whether Enron was overpriced. (""Start with a pretty straightforward question: How exactly does Enron make its money?"") The routine cashing in of stock options that were about to expire by key executives was portrayed in the media as a fire sale. (Skilling had sold $33 million worth, Ken Lay and Ken Rice close to four times that amount.) Then the Wall Street Journal reported on a fund run by the CFO that had been a source of strife within the company. (It was essentially risk management against Enron's possible failures.) Every negative story seemed to produce a concurrent drop in the stock price: By late August it had fallen below $40. Enron, so institutionally unforgiving, finally got a taste of its own medicine. ""When Wall Street is in love with a stock, they're forgiving of something like accounting,"" says Carol Coale. ""When a company falls out of favor, all these issues carry more weight.""
This fact was not lost on people inside the company, who suddenly started experiencing an attack of conscience. Those who had looked the other way as the most powerful Enron executives dumped their wives and married their secretaries or carried on flagrant interoffice affairs now saw the error of their ways. ""It just created an attitude,"" one executive still at Enron says. ""If senior people are doing that, why are we held to a higher standard? There was a real culture of 'We're above everyone else.'"" 
Loyalty had never been prized at Enron, so there was no reason to expect it now. An old-fashioned, slow-moving company like Exxon could demand hardship duty in Baku with the promise of greater rewards down the road. ""But,"" as one Houston oilman explains, ""if you have to negotiate a hardship duty with someone who doesn't have loyalty and has money, then you have a corporation that's better suited for good times than bad.""
As it turned out, that description applied to Jeff Skilling too. As the stock price stubbornly refused to ascend, he made no secret of his unhappiness and frustration. Then, after a trip to visit the families of three employees killed at a plant in England, he had an epiphany: Life was short; for him, Enron was over. Ever stoic, Ken Lay returned to the CEO's office, named a new president, arranged a trip to New York to calm analysts and investors, and promised a kinder, gentler Enron in the future. Trading anything and everything was out. The company, Lay says, will still innovate but ""innovate much closer to our core."" As for the culture: ""Things like the Performance Review Committee, I think we could have applied better. By trying to categorize people into so many different categories, you ended up creating a morale problem.""
That Skilling's supposedly brilliant colleagues were as shocked at the news of his departure as the rest of the business community may be testament to their lack of emotional intelligence. Despite Skilling's lengthy tenure with Enron, he'd always been contemptuous of the long haul; he'd always believed in cutting losses and moving on. But now that he was abandoning them when the company was in trouble, it was different. ""Even Jeff's biggest detractors wouldn't have wanted him to walk out the door,"" one loyalist admits.
But on the day we meet, Skilling is looking forward, not back. ""Look,"" he says with finality, ""ninety percent of my net worth is in Enron. Were my interests aligned with the shareholders? Absolutely.""
Free of falling stock prices and shareholder pressures, he is nestling himself back into the world of ideas. His eyes flash as he talks about new technologies. ""The first wave never gets it right,"" he says. ""The stand-alone dot-coms didn't work, but the technological applications will create a second wave that will change the world."" Houston, he promises, will become the world's center of commodity trading, and he intends to be a part of it. In fact, he is already shopping for office space.
""This is the second wave, and Enron's got it,"" he says, almost breathless. ""There are thousands of people running around the streets of Houston that get it.""

Enron employees not participating in contract parking are eligible to receive Metro Bus Passes or Woodlands Express Passes.  You may pick up a bus pass from the Parking & Transportation Desk, on Level 3 of the Enron Building, from 8:30 AM to 4:30 PM. 


All Metro passes offered through the Enron Parking & Transportation desk will be the Metro 30 Day Zone Pass.  When you use a 30-day zone pass, bus service is divided into four zones w/ unlimited rides.  The zone pass is time activated, which means that it will not become active until the first time it is used and will not expire until 30 days after it was used for the first time.  New passes will be available to Enron employees upon expiration of the 30 day time period. Each zone does have a different fare values based on the distance the bus travels. This is important to any buser who wants to transfer to or travel in a higher-cost zone than the zone pass they have, in this case the difference must be paid in cash.  If they are traveling in a lower cost zone, then there is no extra cost.

As I am not involved in the daily operations behind this deal, I will need your input in order to respond to this request.  As I have indicated, the frequency of cuts has caused tremedous concern and Citizens is considering walking away from this deal.  They need assurance that this gas is going to flow in order to continue.  Do we need to have a meeting?  And when can I expect a response from the desk?

As I have discussed with you, Citizens is concerned about the frequency of upstream supply issues that have resulted in the recent cuts in the deliveries to the Griffith power plant.  Based on the information I have received, the reasons for these cuts have not risen to the level of Force Majeure, which as you know is the only event that would excuse performance under our contract for firm delivery of gas.  Citizens therefore requests that Enron respond to Citizens in writing with a descriptions of the steps Enron is taking to insure that there is not a continuation of these contract performance issues into the future. Your prompt attention to this matter is appreciated.  "

Here's an update of what we discussed during the call.

We told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their interests and to regain their confidence. Our focus remains on our credit quality, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued success and expansion of our wholesale businesses.

It took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. Here's a snapshot of significant events that led to our current situation:

-- In hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-core businesses over the past several years. Those include investments in Azurix, India and Brazil. They have performed far worse that we could have ever imagined when we made these investments;

-- Because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a company. The negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the extensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet;

-- We also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of investor confidence, which has been very damaging;

-- We've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-understand financial and operating disclosures; and

-- On top of it all, we discovered errors in our financial statements, as discussed in our 8-K filing last week, that required a restatement of previously reported earnings.

We've taken a new look at our businesses and have separated them into three areas: core businesses, non-core businesses, and businesses under review.

Core Businesses

Our core businesses remain strong and consistent sources of significant earnings and cash flows for the company. They're our competitive advantage. These include:

-- Natural gas pipeline businesses;

-- Gas and power businesses in North America and Europe;

-- Retail businesses in North America and Europe; and

-- Coal businesses in North America and Europe.

The events of the past few weeks have had a temporary negative impact on our projected fourth quarter profitability. It's too early to tell at this time what impact this might have on our operating results. We are considering these actions now so that we can quickly return to normal business in 2002.

I also remain optimistic that the actions we've taken over the past couple of weeks have addressed our customer and counterparty credit and liquidity concerns. According to our business unit leaders, we have definitely seen improvement in our counterparty relationships.

Non-Core Businesses

Our non-core businesses include our global assets group and our broadband division. We have invested more than $8 billion in these businesses, and the return from them has been dismal.

We have an aggressive program in place to exit these businesses and expect that the sale of these businesses will generate billions of dollars in cash that we can use to repay debt and reinvest in our core businesses. We already have more than $800 million in assets contracted for sale this year. They include CEG Rio, a gas LDC in Brazil; EcoElectrica, a power plant and LNG receiving terminal in Puerto Rico; and asset sales of offshore oil and gas properties in India. The approximately $2.9 billion Portland General sale is also on target to close in late 2002 pending regulatory approvals.

Businesses Under Review

These businesses are comprised of those operations outside our power and gas wholesale businesses and include global and industrial markets. While several of these businesses have very strong future prospects, we need to determine if their capital requirements and near-term growth prospects are sufficient enough in terms of earnings and cash generation.

Reviewing our businesses this way will help determine where we need to make reductions to our work force. More information will follow as soon as it becomes available.

Credit Rating/10-Q Filing

We continue to meet regularly with credit rating agencies and believe that our liquidity enhancements and scheduled asset sales will strengthen our balance sheet and maintain our investment grade credit rating. Our current credit ratings by the three major rating agencies are as follows:

-- Moody's at Baa3       ""Under Review for Further Downgrade""

-- Fitch at BBB-             ""Evolving Status""

-- S&P at BBB-              ""CreditWatch Negative""

We also discussed our existing financial vehicles, including Osprey, Marlin and Yosemite, in further detail. We told investors that we will file our 10-Q five days late due to our current activities. It will be filed on Nov. 19.

We will continue to have updates with investors over the coming weeks as well as our frequent updates with you. The full transcript of our conference call will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the next few days. It will also be posted on our web site at www.enron.com/corp/investors under ""SEC Filings.""

 

 

In connection with the proposed transactions, Dynegy and Enron will file a joint proxy statement/prospectus with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Investors and security holders are urged to carefully read the joint proxy statement/prospectus regarding the proposed transactions when it becomes available, because it will contain important information.

Dear West,

We talked briefly on Monday about our commitment to a full work day at Enron.  If you are in the office, then please be prepared to contribute to the group for a full day.  Our schedule now calls for critical communication in the afternoons.  We need to know that each employee will be here every day to create the consistency needed to outperform the rest of the market.  

We want to remain as flexible as possible with all traders when it comes to an emergency, but remember that you have a commitment to Enron to contribute a full work day.  

Please organize your vacation on the west desk calendar with Ina and coordinate any early afternoon departures with Ina and myself.  Also, prepare to have your markets covered when you leave the office early.

Sincerely,

Mike

In our previous communication, we indicated that we would provide you with more detailed information as it became available.

Beginning Friday, October 26, 2001 at 9 a.m. C.S.T, the procedure for calling Enron's Houston offices from international locations, excluding Canada, using the 800-97-Enron phone number will change.  The new procedure is as follows: 

1.	Please dial the WorldPhone International Access number for the country where you are located (country access code), which is available on the attached wallet card, accessible through the following link:  http://home.enron.com:84/messaging/mciannouncement.doc.    
2.	You will then be prompted for your PIN number.  Since calling cards and pin numbers are not required to use this service, all users should respond by dialing 1-800-97-ENRON or 1-800-973-6766. 
3.	You will then be asked to enter your destination.  Please dial 0-800-97-Enron (800-973-6766) to reach Enron's corporate offices in Houston.
  
This procedure can only be used to call 800-97-Enron from WorldPhone International locations.  If you are calling from the U. S. or Canada, please continue to dial 1-800-97-ENRON.
  
If you have questions regarding commercial aspects of this agreement, please feel free to contact Tom Moore, GSS senior contract manager at 713-345-5552.  For technical issues, please contact Hasan Imam, ENW IT manager at 713-345-8525.

We are still interested, just reviewing our plans. We do have some studies
to finish before we could make an offer.  When we first talked, you did
mention that you are willing to make a payment of the difference between the
tariff and what we agree would be the market for the transportation. I am
assuming that this is still the case.

As one of the enhanced security measures we have recently employed, we will be checking employee badges at the entrance to the ballroom.  All employees will be required to present a valid Enron badge with a photo.  If you do not currently have a photo on your badge, please go to the badge office on the third floor of the Enron Building and have your photo added to your badge.  We also suggest allowing a bit more time in getting to the Hyatt and we request your patience, as these security measures may create some backup at the entrance to the ballroom.

Accessing the Meeting via Streaming Audio/Video
If you are a Houston-based employee and can't attend the meeting, or if you are located in London, Calgary, Toronto, Omaha, New York or Portland (ENA), you can access the live event at <http://home.enron/employeemeeting>.  Enron Europe employees will receive a follow-up message from their Public Relations team concerning online access to the meeting.

Video Teleconferencing
The meeting will be made available by video teleconference to employees in Sao Paulo, Buenos Aires, Dubai, Rio de Janeiro, Bothell, Wash., Denver, San Ramon, Calif., and Chicago.  If your location would like to participate by video teleconference, please contact Yvonne Francois at (713) 345-8725.

I received this email from Karen Taylor at Duke Field Services.  I have been working with her on gathering deals whereby ENA could purchase 3rd party gas on the Jonah Gas Gathering system.  As you can see, a numerber of our larger trading counterparties are not willing to trade with us, but are unwiling to tell us directly.  I hope this is a short term problem, as most of the larger counterparties account for the majority of our transactions.  I've included the second part of the email to show you both that I am willing to extend myself in whatever manner to bring value to the once mighty Enron.

PS  I haven't been able to close any deals with Karen, but I feel that I am very close!

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John"

Jeff, I did leave you a message on Friday that I was unable to meet with DWR on monday... You and I need to hook up on Monday to discuss plan of attack regarding gas and as per your original message I agree with you, it starts with some basic discussions around their intent, vs trying to bang out a Master agreement that may go no where. 

Talk to you today I hope.

As a follow up to the written warning on August 14, 2001 to Heidi Dubose regarding her poor job performance I would like to submit the following commentary:

Heidi's phone coverage is still very inadequate.  I have had two discussions with her in the last 2 weeks regarding this.  She consistently does not take messages properly.  Most of the time all she tells us is the person's first name and that they are holding.  When she does get the last name it is incorrect at least half of the time.  She rarely gets the company name, and when she does it is incorrect or mispelled.

The kitchen areas continue to be unkept and dirty.  She has started to put the dishes in the dishwasher but she rarely unloads them.  If she does it is after they have been in there for days.

We continue to run out of office supplies and she does not consistently monitor the office needs.


In summary, Heidi's performance has improved some since August 14 but that improvement is not seen on a consistent basis.  She has not elevated her performance to the level which is required to manage the office.

I received this email from Karen Taylor at Duke Field Services.  I have been working with her on gathering deals whereby ENA could purchase 3rd party gas on the Jonah Gas Gathering system.  As you can see, a numerber of our larger trading counterparties are not willing to trade with us, but are unwiling to tell us directly.  I hope this is a short term problem, as most of the larger counterparties account for the majority of our transactions.  I've included the second part of the email to show you both that I am willing to extend myself in whatever manner to bring value to the once mighty Enron.

PS  I haven't been able to close any deals with Karen, but I feel that I am very close!

Greetings Jaime:

Wanted to follow up on our meeting. We are still planning to get together as discussed and are working on our packet of information. This will  include a general overview of supply demand fundamentals and pipeline expansions.

Could you please provide information on the following:

1) CFE - what is their charter and how do they relate to PEMEX
2) RFP process for CFE projects - how does it work, who are the usual participants
3) PEMEX - how are their transportation and sales tariffs structured
                  how is it changing (undbundling?)
4) Regulatory intiatives of the CRE

Is there anything else you would like to know? We look forward to our meeting ...

Dear Friends,

After having had the chance to meet you all, I wanted to take an opportunity to collectively thank you and reiterate one last time how much a rotation into your esteemed group means to me. I assure you that, whatever shortcomings you may feel I have, can be overcome by my proven ability to work hard, dedication and dogged ambition.  

As I expressed to a number of you, I am certainly open to undertaking any assigned readings and/or classes you may like to recommend in anticipation of a December rotation.  I would like to do my utmost to hit the ground running and prove my worth.

Thanks so much again.  I look forward to staying in touch and hopefully having the chance to see you all again very soon.

Best Wishes,
Vikram"

[1] Power Authority Faces Legislative Backlash 
After a three-month honeymoon, the new California Power Authority 
is being shredded in the winds of politics this week with the Legislature 
looking into its deals, the California Energy Commission annoyed with its 
monopolizing ventures and the Department of Water Resources rebuffing 
its plan to sell its power through state contracts. Other than skepticism 
from legislative staff about its microturbine bid plan, the Power Authority 
escaped major problems in its requests for bids for photovoltaics and 
fuel cells at [18]. 
[18] Assembly to Investigate Power Authority 
(from [1]) 
Is the California Power Authority a dangerously 
out-of-control state agency, or is it the best hope for get-ting 
back some state control over electricity supplies? 
The Joint Legislative Audit Committee is looking into the 
Power Authority's role thus far in carrying out the letter 
and spirit of SBx2-6 in a hearing set for November 1. 
The move is spearheaded by the offices of Assem-blymember 
Fred Keeley (D-Boulder Creek), the chair 
of the joint committee, and Assembly speaker Bob 
Hertzberg (D-Van Nuys). Both members were princi-pal 
authors of the Power Authority's enabling legisla-tion, 
SBx2-6. Legislative staff are questioning the 
Energy Foundation's unpaid role in devel-oping 
the Power Authority's requests for bids, particularly 
the RFB for microtur-bines. Only one com-pany, 
Capstone, can meet the requirement written into the RBF by the Energy 
Foundation, and staff are looking into potential overlaps 
between Capstone and the Energy Foundation. 
Political maneuvers are swirling around the Con-sumer 
Power and Conservation Financing Authority. 
Not only elected officials are concerned; the staff and 
heads of other agencies the Power Authority must 
work with are digging in their collective heels to op-pose 
Power Authority overtures. Tom Hannigan, di-rector 
of the Department of Water Resources rebuffed 
Power Authority board chair David Freeman's pro-posal 
to have it buy peaker output. California Energy 
Commission members said they are at policy odds 
with the Power Authority's siting plans. 
In an October 4 letter to Freeman, Hannigan said 
that the Power Authority's power-wind and fossil 
peakers-is likely too expensive, overblown and not 
able to respond quickly enough to balancing power 
needs. ""The letters of intent already approved by the 
Power Authority could far exceed [DWR's] ability to ab-sorb 
that power given the outlook for net-short need."" 
Freeman assumes that the market for Power Authority 
power will be via contract, not the spot market. ""Selling 
on the spot market is difficult to finance and risky,"" said 
Power Authority spokesperson Amber Pasricha. 
The Power Authority is the only agency cur-rently 
in the position of actually being able to acquire 
new energy as the state's $12.5 billion bond issue to 
underwrite continued DWR power purchases is in 
limbo and the California Independent System Operator 
is still not creditworthy. Still, the Power Authority 
cannot issue bonds until it has its own economic 
house in order, and an Assembly investigation might 
jeopardize that [J.A. Savage].

Earlier this week, Enron Global Technology announced the plan to decommission the use of all non-standard Internet Email address formats. As mentioned in the previous communication, this was the first of several communications to be sent by the Enron Global Technology group and we will continue to provide more details in the coming weeks regarding this significant but necessary change to our Email environment.
 
We are working toward a cut-off date of January 14, 2002, at which time we will no longer support Email addresses that do not follow the standard format of firstname.lastname@enron.com (or firstname.middleinitial.lastname@enron.com if your name in Lotus Notes or Outlook has a middle initial in it). We understand that it will take time to make the necessary arrangements to begin using the standard Email address format, but it is important to begin making the change now.
 
If you have questions, please send an Email to Enron.Messaging.Administration@enron.com.
 
Thank you for your support.

Subject: Supported Internet Email Addresses



Enron Global Technology is in the process of decommissioning the support for all non-standard Internet Email address formats. The only Internet Email address format that will be supported, once this effort is completed, is firstname.lastname@enron.com. We will no longer support Internet Email address formats such as name@enron.com, name@ect.enron.com, name@ei.enron.com  (where ""name"" is an abbreviation, acronym or alternative to an employees firstname and/or lastname). Every Enron employee has an Internet Email address of firstname.lastname@enron.com and must begin making the necessary arrangements to start using this Internet address format if they are not using it already.

Any new/existing application systems or business cards that reference a non-supported Internet Email address will need to be changed to reference the only supported firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet address format. It is important to remember to also notify any external contacts who are currently sending Internet email to any non-supported Internet Email addresses.

To determine what your supported Internet Email address is, take your name as it appears in Outlook or Lotus Notes and replace any ""spaces"" that appear in your name with periods and append @enron.com. For example in Outlook, Alan Smith, Robert (firstname = Robert, Lastname = Alan Smith) will have a supported Internet Email address of robert.alan.smith@enron.com.

IMPORTANT : If you need to update your business card(s) to reflect your supported Internet Email address, please ensure you test & confirm the delivery of Internet email to your supported email address prior to updating your business cards. If you experience any issues with delivery of Internet email to your supported Internet email address, please contact the Resolution Center.

We will communicate further details, including the cut-off date, in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, it is imperative that you begin making the necessary arrangements to change over to using the firstname.lastname@enron.com Internet Email address format. If you have questions regarding this email, send an Email to enron.messaging.administration@enron.com.

Thank you for participation, cooperation and support.

Their ""angle"" is that the existing utility, Powder River Electric Coop, cannot meet the demand for electricity and the necessary distribution infrastructure to maintain the pace of development in the Coal Bed Methane BOOM that is happening in the basin.  

As you may or may not know, Enron has been very involved in this Coal Bed Methane play since 1998.  ENA is the largest purchaser of 3rd party gas in the basin and Crestone is the largest non-producer gathering company in the basin.  Crestone has a gathering trunkline located near their proposed site.  The developers will be filing a petition to remove this area from the COOP's certificated territory in the next couple of weeks.

There are obviously regulatory issues revolving around their ability to gain access to this ""retail"" market and the project would not be economically feasible as a merchant plant in the wholesale market.  However, they seem to have some political backing.

These developers recognize that they need Enron's assistance in developing this project on three main fronts:

1.  Power Marketing and Project development
2.  Gas Supplies and Pipeline access
3.  Regulatory and Transmission expertise

Given the fact that Joe Meyer is the early favorite to be the next Wyoming Governor and we are trying to work well with the State of Wyoming, and we have a natural competitive advantage in this market from a gas supply and pipeline perspective, I would like to pursue this opportunity a little further.

Therefore, I am wondering if I could get a Sr. Commercial Power Representative and a Regulatory Representative (Steve Walton would be good since he will be on the Wyoming Energy Commission), to attend a meeting in Denver with myself and the Crestone representatives sometime in the next 2 weeks.

Please give me a call and I can elaborate on the opportunity or answer your questions.  I don't want to make this email a novel!

Thanks a lot.

Thanks for the note back.... yeah, I am still kicking.... and I am sure
you know this that it will take a little more than a bankruptcy to shake
this guy... when I grab on , I grab on tight.... 

Sorry for putting you through the inconvenience of having to read our
documents.. I think we have all had to dust off the paper... but I
sincerely hope most of it is behind us. 

I knew Karen was at Progas, glad to hear that she is enjoying work... 

I have not been to Calgary since May, and am not sure when I will be
back up... and if it will be on a permanent of temporary basis.... all
in all Houston is treating us pretty good.  Work really has been great
and I have such a good marketing region... california, arizona,
Denver.... vegas... are some of the highlights... so when I need to, I
go blow a few braincells out in one of these fine regions..

Kim is working a little ( 2 shifts in 1 year).... she may have to pick
up the pace on that effort... ( she is fighting me on that one)... House
is good, weather right now is great... 80 degrees ( all the time)...
there is something to be said about living in shorts and sandals... 

Better run, take care, talk soonest.

hey guy,

rumours of your demise are greatly exageerated !

I'm surviving - just finished an NEB Hearing yesterday on our bypass
pipeline (bypasses NGTL in the Med Hat area). The week before that we
had
this little meltdown of our strategic alliance partner which caused a
few
sleepless nights and much reading of the contracts...but we survived.

karen is over at progas and seems to be enjoying it.

when are you coming up to the great white north ? let me know and we
should
have a beer and shot some pool.

Susan and I will circulate a draft response against Dynegy's position later today.  ComEd plans to file a lengthy answer disputing Dynegy stating that there are no transmission problems due to the use of the firm LD resources and that FERC precedent does not support a capacity payment requirement.

Enron will respond similarly and include an argument that Dynegy is actually trying to create an ""icap/capacity"" requirement where there is none (Dynegy's pleading states ""ComEd's failure to enforce the network designation provisions of its OATT also deprives Dynegy of capacity payments to which it is entitled.)  We will also include statements that the continuation of the network v. PTP transmission tariffs perpetuates these types of issues and the market/tariff design that we advocate should be approved to stop these problems.

Subject:	Dynegy vs. ComEd (EL02-6) -- further info

As I mentioned in my previous e-mail, on October 17 Dynegy filed a complaint against ComEd.  This proceeding may be of particular interest to Enron given EES's plans to offer physical delivery in Illinois in early 2002.  I've outlined Dynegy's principal arguments below.  Dynegy requested fast-track processing, so any intervention and comments we file are due Friday, Oct. 26.  In order to file a timely intervention (and meaningful comments, if we decide to comment), I need to know your thoughts on this as soon as possible.  Elizabeth and Harlan, I'm copying you because I would especially like to know what you think of Dynegy's characterization of the Firm LD product.

Main argument:
Dynegy challenges ComEd's published Business Practice that allows ""marketer firm"" (Firm LD) contracts to be designated as Network Resources.  Dynegy argues that this practice conflicts with the OATT provisions that 1) Network Resources are generation ""owned, purchased or leased by the Network Customer designated to serve Network Load,"" and 2) a Network Customer ""must demonstrate that it owns or has committed to purchase generation pursuant to an executed contract"" in order to designate a Network Resource.

Dynegy's theory on why Firm LD should not be a Network Resource:

	- permits designation of network resources that are committed for sale to others, creating reliability problems
	- Firm LD under the EEI contract is not capacity-backed, nor is it a commitment to purchase generation
	- allows transmission customers to get the advantage of generation capacity without actually paying the cost of that capacity
	- since retail providers are allowed to rely on ""over-the-counter"" firm instead of securing long-term contracts, adequate reserves are not being carried to serve retail load
	
Dynegy claims that ComEd's practice has deprived DMG of payments for capacity and the ability to earn revenues for capacity properly designated as network resources.  It cites specific instances in which ComEd has accepted transmission reservation requests from New Energy and Cilco in which these parties designated Illinois Power as a network resource, when only a Firm LD contracts were in place with IP.

By MARK GOLDEN, KRISTEN MCNAMARA, JON KAMP and JOHN EDMISTON
   Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES
NEW YORK -- Energy trading companies have concerns about the credit quality of troubled Enron Corp. (ENE), but they have made almost no changes in policies concerning the top trader of North American power and gas, the companies said Thursday.
The concerns have arisen because Enron, which accounts for about a quarter of the trade in the country's power and gas markets, has seen its share price fall by a third this week due to uncertainties about its extremely complex financial structure.
Moody's has put Enron's credit on watch for possible downgrade, and some of the company's debt is trading like junk bonds in the secondary market this week.
""We have made no changes to our credit policy concerning Enron,"" said John Sousa, chief spokesmann for Dynegy Inc. (DYN). ""It's business as usual.""
Williams Cos. (WMB) spokesman Jim Gipson said that his company, too, has made no changes and has no concerns about Enron's credit. Another Top 10 power and gas trading company, Aquila (ILA), has also left Enron credit unchanged.
Other companies expressed concern, though they've taken little if any action.
""Like everyone else in the marketplace, we're proceeding with caution,"" said Lora Kinner, director of credit for Tractebel Energy Marketing, the North American subsidiary of the Belgian company Tractebel S.A.
Kinner said the company is just looking for more information and doesn't expect to make any drastic changes.
Like many utilities, the Public Service Co. of New Mexico (PNM) is ""monitoring the situation."" So is Aquila, said Mark Gurley, general manager of trading at the company.
""We haven't altered our credit policy at all,"" Gurley said. But if Enron's credit rating slips, ""our tolerances for risk with them would go down,"" he said.
A trading manager for another energy company said that all energy and financial companies that have dealings with Enron are assessing their exposure. But that manager's company has made no changes and doesn't expect Enron to have cash liquidity problems.
One large firm has been limiting the credit it extends to Enron for the past month. A gas trader with another firm has been encouraged to do more business on other energy trading platforms like the InterContinental Exchange. Enron, however, is far too big to cut off entirely, traders said.
Energy trading companies depend on Enron as the major market maker for their commodities. Enron built the over-the-counter wholesale gas marketplace, and more recently its two-year-old electronic trading platform, EnronOnline, has become a major marketplace for gas and power, accounting for 25% of those markets, according to one recent estimate.
   Enron is the counterparty to every trade on the system.  
EnronOnline grew so quickly because of the company's policy
that traders must offer aggressive two-way spreads - both
bids and offers - on the commodities they trade. Any
reduction in EnronOnline volumes could translate to an
immediate liquidity problem for North American power
markets.
""If there is a problem with Enron, there's going to be domino effect through the industry,"" Tractebel's Kinner said.
Uncertainties about Enron's financial situation have aggravated the volatility of gas futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange, a trader said.
Gas and power traders said that Enron traders are moving to liquidate some positions and, because the company's problems are well known, it is getting squeezed in the market, which would discount the return on positive positions.
Enron traders have few outstanding favors to call on with counterparties, because Enron traders have been so aggressive over the years, the trading manager said.
Analysts have raised questions about Enron's difficulties on a number of conference calls held by other energy companies to discuss their quarterly earnings reports. One of those companies, Sempra Energy (SRE), said it was monitoring the situation but saw little risk so far.
""At this point, there's no reason for concern,"" Sempra spokesman Doug Kline said. ""We continue to trade with them, and they're covering their margins.""

Subject: Natural Gas Origination


Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John"

rumours of your demise are greatly exageerated !

I'm surviving - just finished an NEB Hearing yesterday on our bypass
pipeline (bypasses NGTL in the Med Hat area). The week before that we had
this little meltdown of our strategic alliance partner which caused a few
sleepless nights and much reading of the contracts...but we survived.

karen is over at progas and seems to be enjoying it.

when are you coming up to the great white north ? let me know and we should
have a beer and shot some pool.

cheers

As you all understand the state of our trading condition, this email is to inform you of another two counter parties who have explained to me why they cannot do business with us at this time.  Dominion E & P and England Energy will no longer sell us gas, until they see clear direction and can accurately predict the outcome of the Dynergy/Enron merger.  They both wish us good luck and wanted to say this is strictly a business decision and that they would want to continue business once we get things resolved.  I'm sure you both are seeing this type of thing first hand.  

I feel like I'm back in high school trying to date without a car.  They said it then like they say it now, ""it's not you Paul, we just feel we would be better off if we found someone new.""

As you know, this is an unprecedented time in Enron's history.  We must adapt our employee programs to fit the immediate needs of our company during this time of transition.  It is especially difficult to announce the immediate suspension of the following programs.

?	ClickAtHome - Enron has suspended the ClickAtHome program.  The program will no longer accept new participants, PC orders, or Internet service orders.  Orders submitted and confirmed prior to November 20, 2001 will be honored.  Enron will also discontinue subsidized Internet service.  Effective January 1, 2002, employees who are currently subscribers to subsidized Internet service will be switched to the regular commercial rate of their service provider and be responsible for the entire cost of the service.
?	Matching Gifts and Volunteer Incentive Program (VIP) - Enron's Matching Gift program and VIP grants have been suspended indefinitely.  As we consider the immediate needs of all employees during this trying time, it is appropriate that we discontinue the dollar for dollar match for charitable contributions as well as cash donations recognizing employees' volunteer hours with non-profit organizations.  Matching Gift or VIP submissions received prior to November 20 will be honored.

We regret that we have had to make these changes.  We must continue to look for ways to reduce operating expenses through this transition period.

We have been working with Hewitt and Northern Trust since July.  We understand your concerns and are committed to making this transition period as short as possible without jeopardizing the reconciliation of both the Plan in total or your account in particular.  

Remember that the Enron Corp. Savings Plan is an investment vehicle for your long-term financial goals.  The Enron plan will continue to offer a variety of investment opportunities with different levels of risk.  

As always, we advise you to review your overall investment strategy and carefully weigh the potential earnings of each investment choice against its risk before making investment decisions that are aligned with your long-term financial plans and your risk tolerance. 

For that reason, it is critical that ALL trades among your investment funds be completed by 3:00 PM CST Friday, October 26 before the transition period begins."

Interesting reading, boys, following up on our conversations last night.

-M


October 24, 2001 
Dynegy vs. Enron:
A ""Tale of Two Companies""  
By Will McNamara
Director, Electric Industry Analysis 


Facts: Dynegy Inc. (NYSE: DYN) beat expectations in the third quarter, reporting that its earnings rose to $286 million, or 85 cents per diluted share, from $177 million, or 55 cents per diluted share, for the same period in 2000. This represented a 22-percent increase from 3Q 2000 and boosted the company's 2001 earnings estimate. Dynegy has a market capitalization of $14.5 billion. Its stock is currently trading at about $43 down from a 52-week high of $59, although it is important to note that for year-end 2000 the company's stock was one of the top performers among Standard & Poor's 500 companies with a total shareholder return of 218 percent. Dynegy employs 5,778 people.  
Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE) reported $638 million in losses for the third quarter, after taking $1.01 billion in charges associated with several of its non-core businesses. The company's 3Q recurring net income (before the write-offs) increased 35 percent to $393 million, or 43 cents a diluted share, and revenue in the quarter rose to $47.6 billion from $30 billion in 3Q 2000. Enron has a market capitalization of $14.8 billion. Its stock is currently trading at about $16.0, which represents a six-year low for the company and is considerably lower than the peak of $82 hit in August 2000. Enron employs 20,600 people.  
Analysis: Dynegy closed out a banner year in 2000 and appears to still be on a roll in terms of its financial performance. In contrast, Enron faced an unprecedented year of turmoil, and is presently languishing in a low ebb, characterized by a strategic crossroads and heightened scrutiny of the company's financial reporting. While the two companies operate in the same market space of power trading and are fierce competitors, Dynegy-ironically the younger and smaller of the two companies-is an industry success story while Enron's status remains rather uncertain. The questions to be addressed in this article are: What is Dynegy doing ""right""? What is Enron doing ""wrong""? What lessons can other power and natural-gas marketers learn from this ""tale of two companies""? 
Although they are often referred to as ""cross-town rivals,"" Dynegy and Enron are worlds apart in terms of their competitive positions. Their divergent approaches to the global marketplace illustrate what could be the single-most important element related to their disparate positions at the end of 2001. Put more simply, the two companies have vastly different strategies, and-hindsight being 20/20-a strong argument can be made that Dynegy's strategy is the winner at this juncture. Throughout this article, I will focus on two key areas in which Dynegy and Enron differ dramatically. Those two key areas are the ownership of physical generation assets and the extent to which the companies have expanded (and invested) into non-core sectors. 
Both companies started out as natural-gas companies and converged into the power market in the 1990s. However, that is essentially where their similarities end, and over the last few years Enron and Dynegy have followed decidedly different paths. In an attempt to make the complex rather rudimentary, let me summarize the two paths this way: Enron does not believe it needs to own physical assets to be a success in the power and natural-gas trading sector; Dynegy, on the other hand, not only believes in the ownership of physical assets, but has set a goal that could ultimately establish the company as owning one of the largest generation arsenals in the industry.  
Let's look at the companies separately. We'll discuss Enron first since it is the older of the two. Enron readily admits that its strategy is difficult to define, but a close approximation is that Enron literally creates commodity markets so that it can deliver physical commodities to customers. The participation and success in commodity markets, according to Enron, does not necessitate ownership of physical assets. In fact, the company has routinely sold physical assets that are not considered to be strategic to its wholesale business. Rather, Enron has concentrated on developing a new philosophy of risk management excellence, in which it will merely buy and sell the commodities it needs to participate in trading venues.  
As an example, Enron bought Portland General (which owns 2,000 MW of generation and 41,600 kilometers of electric T?lines) in 1996 as a way to launch its penetration of the West Coast power markets. When competition fizzled in that region, Enron put Portland General back on the sales block (a sale of Portland General to Northwest Natural is pending at this writing). Likewise in Europe, where it is one of the most prominent trading companies, Enron has disposed of generation assets such as Sutton Bridge in England and, unlike other U.S. competitors, has refrained from buying additional generating units in opening countries such as Germany and Italy. According to its most recent 10K report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Enron owns or controls 2,015 MW of generating capacity (including joint ownerships), which is drastically lower than the average among other companies operating in the power trading sector.  
Dynegy's approach to the market is crystal clear and radically different from Enron's. In the words of CEO Chuck Watson, ""Dynegy's long-term strategy is to focus on marketing and trading around physical assets, which supports earnings sustainability."" Ever since going public in 1995, Dynegy has been on an acquisition binge, with each purchase significantly increasing its generation capability. Dynegy presently owns or controls about 27,000 MW of generating capacity in the United States, 26 gas-processing plants and 14,000 miles of pipelines, which are located in geographically competitive areas. The company's goal is to own or control 70,000 MW, or 10 percent of the U.S. market, within the next five years. Sometimes, Dynegy has acquired assets through partnerships with other companies such as NRG Energy, but just as often it has purchased assets independently. Most notably, when Dynegy acquired Illinova in early 2000, the purchase doubled Dynegy's generating capacity. Dynegy is now attempting to replicate this approach in Europe, where it is presently planning to purchase natural-gas storage facilities in England. Dynegy executives have argued that natural-gas storage is the best way to back up a natural-gas trading operation. There's no question that the approach is working. Out of the $286 million that Dynegy reported in the third quarter, $263 million of it came from the company's main wholesale business.  
The issue of asset ownership is probably the central defining difference between Enron and Dynegy, and its significance should not be overlooked. It is not difficult to make a case that supports Dynegy's approach. Owning physical assets often enables a trading company to gain information in the course of operating power plants that can help the company to gauge markets and anticipate small changes in price. In other words, by controlling the actual output of generation instead of just being involved in buys and sells, a trader such as Dynegy will theoretically know what the load is going to be in a particular region, how much power can be produced to meet that load and when shortages might occur. In addition, in markets that are short on infrastructure, it may be difficult for a trader to participate in the market unless they actually have ownership of physical assets in the region. By the same token, those companies that do control physical assets often have greater communication with grid operators, and possible insight to spreads (the difference between various energy prices). In fact, Dynegy's CEO Watson fully acknowledges that his company excels at being able to trade around the volatility of price, and being capable of resolving balances when shortages exist. This may be more difficult for a company such as Enron to accomplish when it has no physical generation of its own to meet discrepancies in power bids. Dynegy's strategy of acquiring both natural-gas pipelines and power plants also gives it the flexibility to trade on both commodities. 
On the other side of this argument, a case could be made that Enron's approach provides more flexibility in reacting to trading volatility. Certainly, by investing less in power generation facilities, Enron has less capital on the line when compared to a company like Dynegy. Under a scenario when market prices suddenly drop, a company such as Enron that does not have heavy capital invested in power generation could actually fare better than an asset-laden company because Enron does not face the pressure to meet the fixed payments of a generation facility. Asset-heavy companies also may find that their earnings could be impacted by the investment in generation facilities in times of extreme price volatility. As the industry becomes increasingly focused on bottom-line results, this could be seen as a potential concern for investors. Further, some would argue that Enron's approach of establishing purchasing contracts with various parties to meet its buy and sell requirements is the rough equivalent of owning a generation facility. What Enron gains by this approach is the presumed flexibility it has by not being tied down to a specific generation unit and being able to build its own portfolio. 
Consequently, the issue of asset ownership can perhaps be considered the ""great debate"" among power traders. However, although Dynegy's overall performance in the third quarter was better than Enron's, that does not necessarily provide a clear endorsement of Dynegy's strategy toward acquiring new generation facilities. Keep in mind that Enron's 3Q losses resulted primarily from non-recurring charges related to its non-core businesses (broadband and water in particular). Without these charges, Enron's core wholesale trading business continues to perform well. This is a point that CEO Ken Lay has been quick to reiterate to investors. ""Our 26-percent increase in recurring earnings per diluted share shows the very strong results of our core wholesale and retail energy businesses and our natural-gas pipelines,"" Lay said. ""The continued excellent prospects in these businesses and Enron's leading market position make us very confident in our strong earnings outlook."" 
Moreover, perhaps even more than ownership of physical assets, the key issue that played a role in the current disparity between Dynegy and Enron earnings in the third quarter is the companies' approach to developing new lines of business.  Telecom is a perfect example to illustrate the point. Enron, which prides itself as usually gaining a first-strike advantage, plunged into the telecom sector well ahead of other energy companies. Under the leadership of then-CEO Jeffrey Skilling, Enron sunk large sums of capital into purchasing broadband capacity on the expectation that the market would quickly become lucrative. Now Lay admits that the company ""could have gotten into the broadband business with less capital"" and that Enron ""spent too much too soon"" in this sector. Nevertheless, Enron recorded an $80-million non-recurring write-down for restructuring its broadband unit in the third quarter and is presently attempting to stop the bleeding in this sector by reducing future costs in this sector to $40 million a quarter.  
Dynegy took a much more cautious approach toward expanding into the telecom sector and made a comparatively small amount of investment when compared to Enron. Dynegy has likewise been impacted by the slowdown of the telecom sector, but in the third quarter took a $15-million loss in its broadband business compared to the $80-million loss that Enron reported. However, Dynegy clearly specializes in marketing and trading two commodities (electricity and natural gas) and seems to add other businesses in a very methodical way that merely supplements its core business. 
It is also important to note that Enron gained the first-strike advantage when it developed EnronOnline, an electronic trading exchange. In fact, Enron was the first to create such an exchange in the energy space, well ahead of its competitors. Dynegy later followed this trend with creating Dynegydirect. The two exchanges are different in terms of their trading standards, but it is important to acknowledge that in this particular case Enron was successful in launching into the electronic trading space well ahead of its competitors. The latest available information indicates that EnronOnline has recorded transactions that exceed $590 in notional value. Since its inception in November 2000, Dynegydirect has recorded $33 billion in notional transactions.  
At this juncture, Dynegy and Enron are very different with regard to their approaches toward financial reporting. Enron, which has often been accused of not providing a balance sheet to investors, is currently struggling from a serious image problem as the Securities and Exchange Commission pursues an investigation of possible mishandling of funds by Enron's CFO. To my recollection, no one has ever accused Dynegy of not providing a balance sheet, and thus the company's status with investors is arguably more solid. As I don't expect either company to radically alter its competitive strategy any time soon, my projection is that (at least in the near term), we will continue to see a wide disparity in Wall Street performance between Dynegy and Enron. That is not to say that anyone should count Enron out of the game. As noted, the company's core business of wholesale business remains strong, but clearly has been tainted by the impact of other non-core businesses. That doesn't mean Enron is down permanently, but it will have to find a way to strike a better balance between the businesses that it does best and those businesses that former CEO Jeffrey Skilling believed were advantageous. 
In many ways, the comparison between Dynegy and Enron is rather like the tortoise and the hare parable. I am sure you can guess which company is the tortoise and which is the hare in this analogy. The race between the two is far from over, although Dynegy is taking the lead at this point, based on its more methodical approach. What will be fascinating to observe is how both companies continue to adapt to changes in the marketplace and possibly modify what up to this point have been adamantly espoused philosophies.  

Correction statement to 10/23 IssueAlert on European trading: 
According to a news report from Reuters, the U.S.-owned Entergy-Koch Trading was listed as a publicly traded company. I was informed by my contact at Entergy that Entergy-Koch Trading is a limited partnership company and not publicly traded. I apologize for any confusion this error might have caused.

Subject:	LADWP Gas Contract


Dear Potential Gas Supplier

As some of you may know our authority to buy gas off our existing spot agreement
will come to an end on December 31, 2001.  While we will honor current
commitments for gas to be delivered after that date, but we will not be able to
use the spot agreement to buy any more gas.  The reason that this is happening
is that our City Attorney has interpreted the new City Charter as not allowing
delegations of authority such as employed in the way we buy gas now.

We are seeking approval for an ordinance which must be approved by the City
Council that will restore our former ability to buy gas with the kind of
agreement most gas suppliers are familiar.  We have the ordinance approved by
the City Attorney and it will shortly be in the pipeline for approval by our
Board and the City Council, but until then, this contract is a stop gap to keep
us operating.

I've attached the new contract and a cover letter which explains what we are
doing.  The deadline is November 8, 2001 at 4:00 PM.  We will take the executed
contracts to our Board with the counterparties listed on a Board Resolution and,
if it is approved, we will be allowed to buy gas from this group after the new
year begins.  This is not the ideal contract but one we feel our Board will be
comfortable with until we can get around the Charter problem.  I can't make any
changes to this contract.  There is a notice published in the LA Times about the
availability of the contract but I am sending it to you directly as someone we
have already done business with (and undoubtedly have satisfied all our
boilerplate requirements) and will probably be interested in what we are trying
to do here.

I Hope most of you will respond.  Thanks

Brian,

I have one fellow on my team that is scheduled to interview for the Origination Training Track on Wednesday.  His name is Harry Bucalo and he is an Associate.  He has worked for me for the last six months and helped me build the voice trading business.  

He has excellent customer skills and really puts his heart and soul into the job.  I'd like to see him accepted into the program.  He is an excellent candidate.  

Please let me know what further I can do to support his case.

LINKS WEATHER, CLIMATE TO ECONOMY
Data Show Effect of Climate Conditions on Corn and Soybean Yield
and Residential Energy Needs
October 24, 2001 - NOAA <http://www.noaa.gov/> today unveiled two new indices that evaluate the effect of climate conditions on corn and soybean yield and on residential energy needs. The development of the indices is part of NOAA's ""Environomics"" program <http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/research/environomics/environomics.html>, an effort to better understand the impact of weather and climate on socioeconomic sectors of the nation. The indices were developed by NOAA's National Climatic Data Center <http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/ncdc.html> in Asheville, N.C., which maintains the world's largest weather database. (Click NOAA image for larger view of standardized temperature index for Sept. 2001.)
Anecdotal statements about the weather are often used to explain variations in economic activity, and these statements are often based on perceptions about the weather that may or may not be valid. Through NOAA's Environomics program, relationships between the nation's climate and vital economic sectors of the nation are clearly defined using climate indices, which enhance the understanding of how year-to-year variations and trends in weather and climate affect associated sectors.
Thomas Karl <http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/about/welcomefromdirector.html>, director of NOAA's National Climatic Data Center, said, ""Climate indices developed through the Environomics program provide quantitative information regarding climate's influence while providing historical perspective on how weather and climate conditions affecting our economy and society today compare with conditions of the past.""
The period of high energy demand and prices of the late 1970s coincided with extremely cold winters that contributed to higher residential energy usage. The Residential Energy Demand Temperature Index (REDTI), which provides information related to climate sensitive residential energy demand, reflects this increased demand through historically high index values and can be used in part to explain the cause of the historically high energy demand of that time. By providing continuing updates to the index, a clearer understanding of future fluctuations in energy demand will be possible.
The REDTI tracks both unusually hot and unusually cold conditions. It varies from year to year due to variability and trends in temperature, and it responds most strongly to temperature conditions in heavily populated regions. REDTI values range from 0 to 100. Values greater than 90 indicate a much above average temperature-related energy demand and values less than 10 reflect much below average conditions.
The REDTI for the 2001 April-September season was 34, indicative of slightly below average residential energy demand for cooling and heating. Based on the 107 year record, the population-weighted REDTI value of 34 ranks as the 19th lowest value.
The nation's warm season (April-September) 2001 ranked as the fourth warmest such period since 1895, the first year of complete climate records. The preliminary national average temperature was 67.4 F (19.7 C), which was 1.6 F (0.9 C) above the long-term mean. Although the area-weighted national temperature gave the season a rank of fourth warmest on record, the persistence of average to cooler than average temperatures in some of the most heavily populated regions of the U.S. contributed to a REDTI that was below average. Energy usage statistics for 2001 will be available from the Department of Energy's Energy Information Administration in 2002.
While the REDTI provides information on the impacts of temperature on energy demand, the Moisture Stress Index (MSI), was developed to quantify the effect of soil moisture conditions on crop yield. It provides historical perspective on conditions such as moisture stress, that are closely associated with corn and soybean yields and is a source of information for explaining the cause of lower national yields.
The MSI ranges from zero to 100 and specifically measures the proportion of the nation's corn or soybeans affected by severe to catastrophic drought or catastrophic wetness. Values near zero indicate that few productive corn or soybean growing areas were affected by severe drought or catastrophic wetness. This index reflects conditions during July and August and is weighted by the mean (1991-2000) annual crop productivity within 344 climate divisions in the contiguous U.S. Although a number of factors affect the success of a single crop growing season, drought or excessive wetness during critical phases of crop growth have a significant impact on the nation's corn and soybean yield.
Although warmer than average temperatures coincided with drought in some parts of the country during the warm season months of 2001, conditions in the heart of the major corn and soybean crop growing regions were generally normal to wetter than normal. The corn MSI for the 2001 crop growing season was eight, and the soybeans MSI was seven. This means that severe to catastrophic drought or catastrophic wetness affected only 8 percent and 7 percent of the nation's corn and soybeans, respectively. Both index values were below average and reflect favorable soil moisture throughout a large part of the crop growing regions during July and August (the reproductive season).
The MSI for corn exceeded 40 during the drought-plagued growing seasons of 1983 and 1988 and 30 during the catastrophically wet summer of 1993, years in which corn yields were less than 75 percent of the 2000 yield. The 2001 growing season (May-September) followed several years in which national corn and soybean yields were generally high, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The low values of this year's corn and soybean MSI indicate that conditions associated with this index were again favorable for good corn and soybean yields. National crop yields for 2001 will be available from the United States Department of Agriculture following the harvest season.
NOAA is dedicated to enhancing economic security and national safety through the prediction and research of weather and climate-related events and providing environmental stewardship of our nation's coastal and marine resources."

Chris,

My email probably was a bit out of line, sent out of frustration - my apologies.  It was not wise of me to give a trader a heads up on my intent to buy in the first place, going forward I will not do that.  I have no expectation of having Stephan manage anyone's price risk.  I am hoping to develop Cascade into a long-term Enron customer, I make no origination on the deals I have done with them, I have encouraged them to enter into longer term DI deals and I have hooked them up with EOL - all intended to benefit of the cash desk in Calgary.  Next time the market falls $0.12 immediately following a trade I make on behalf of a customer I'll keep my mouth (email) shut.

There is no offence intended by either of these emails and I intend to continue to try and develop more spot and term business for your desk.

Dave,

I just wanted to touch base with you on the cash trade that you intermediated between Stephane and Cascade this morning. I don't really feel that it is Stephane's responsibility to manage Cascades price risk and I think that you are out of line for accusing him of running over your customer. If you would like we could look at doing an  MSA with Cascade where by we could sell them gas at Sumas DI.

Roger,

I hope you're reading your E-mail, because I can't get to you by phone.

Our attorney is checking the contract T&Cs, but I noticed that none of the
corrected company information I provided the last time around is included.
The name of our company is incorrect.  You have Ralph Mill's name with my
address, phone number, and my (incorrect) fax number. The facility name is
incorrect and the street name is misspelled.  All of this was correct on the
last copy I sent you.  Plus, there is no customer contact information on the
second page.

Since the file is protected, I can't even correct this.

How are we going to get this fixed in the next 2 hours?

Mark,

Steph said you were looking for some info on the Western Frontier project that was in NGI today.  I called the contact person at Western Frontier/Williams and he told me that the project was not in fact fully subscribed.  He was obviously interested in speaking with you again.  

I glanced through their filing, and apparently the open season led to PAs for 365,000 Dth/d of the 540,000 Dth/d of available capacity.  PAs have been signed with the following:

Marathon - 75,000 dth/d
Williams Marketing - 200,000 dth/d
Utilicorp United - 15,000 dth/d
Entergy - 75,000 dth/d

With the exception of Marathon, everyone signed up for ten years.  Marathon committed to five years, with an option to extend for two years.  

Let me know if you need anything else.

Phil

MIke,

Attached is the updated summary regarding expansions in the west.  There is only one change - PGT 2003 expansion.  The expansion has now dropped from 230,000 MM/d to 160,000 MM/d due to PPL dropping out.

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work."

Bill, FYI, I have received a formal request from PGT asking Enron to provide security on their pipeline.  The request is for approx $ 11MM. They are referencing a provision in their tariff  that says that if a co. goes below BBB by S&P, then they have the right to ask for security.

I have discussed this request with them and they assure me we are not being singled out. I told them we will review the letter with credit and management and get back to them prior to the deadline imposed on their request( Nov. 20).

A copy of this request will be on your desk first thing this a.m.

NGI's Daily Gas Price Index 
Breaking News : posted Oct 25, 11:12 AM
Breathitt 'Uneasy' About Approach to Pipe Certification 
Although FERC and California regulators have made a lot of headway in past months in their effort to relieve the imbalance between in-state and interstate pipeline capacity, Commissioner Linda Breathitt said Wednesday that she still is somewhat unsettled by FERC's tendency to routinely approve interstate pipe projects without giving full weight to the impact on existing shippers. 
""I remain uneasy about the...policies the Commission has advanced in favor of certification of interstate capacity despite the [inadequacy] of takeaway capacity and particularly the confidence with which the Commission has rejected the legitimate concerns of shippers on [Kern River's] system,"" she said during the regular FERC meeting. 
Breathitt's remarks were part of a concurring opinion on two orders in which FERC denied rehearing of its certificate approval for Kern River Gas Transmission's 2002 Expansion Project and California Action Project [CP01-31, CP01-106-001]. Firm customers of Kern River sought reconsideration of the certificate orders on the grounds that the expansions would result in pro-rata capacity reductions for existing shippers at Wheeler Ridge and would diminish their firm delivery rights. 
Despite her concerns, Breathitt noted that she was ""pleased that over the past six months the Commission has come to acknowledge that our actions in certificating the Kern River expansions could exacerbate the problems of delivering natural gas to end-users in Southern California."" 
Even more importantly, ""the Commission has recognized the potential degradation of shippers' firm rights resulting from the certification of additional interstate capacity is an appropriate factor in the public benefits analysis that we use to determine whether a project is in the public convenience and necessity,"" she said. 
Moreover, ""I am relieved that certain events are occurring in California that will mitigate congestion at Wheeler Ridge. More takeaway capacity is on the horizon, and the California PUC is considering certain regulatory relief that will facilitate the transportation of natural gas from Wheeler Ridge to Southern California markets."" 
Nevertheless, Breathitt urged her FERC colleagues ""not [to] lose sight of the panoply of issues we must consider in issuing natural gas pipeline certificates."" 
This doesn't mean, however, that she is against all new pipelines and expansion projects, Breathitt said. ""I most certainly share the sense of urgency to ensure adequate and reliable energy supplies. However, there is more to the Commission's mandate under the Natural Gas Act than simply getting more pipe in the ground."" 
Breathitt noted that the Commission plans to revisit the issue of the adequacy of California takeaway capacity when it takes up Kern River's pending application for its proposed 2003 Expansion Project [CP01-422]. Firm customers on the pipeline have already protested the application. They claim that Kern River has sold nearly 500,000 Dth/d of additional primary firm delivery point capacity at Wheeler Ridge in the three expansion projects, and that they are experiencing scheduling cuts as a result. 
When the Kern River 2003 expansion comes before the Commission, ""I will continue to advocate a thoughtful and coordinated approach to fostering badly needed interstate and intrastate expansion in California.""

Subject:	FERC Draft Orders on Kern River and PG&E Projects

FERC today issued Draft Orders denying rehearing in the following:

Kern River, CP01-31 (2002 Expansion Project)
Rejected arguments of the Firm Customers that the project should not have been approved or, alternatively, the rights of the expansion shippers at Wheeler Ridge should be subordinate to those of the existing shippers.

PG&E Gas Transmission, NW, CP01-141 (2001 Expansion)
Rejected Newport Northwest LLC's assertion that requiring the expansion shippers to pay a fuel cost surcharge to recover any incremental fuel costs due to the additional compression approved for this project is contrary to FERC precedent and the policy statement on expansion facilities.

These orders should be issued within the next few days, and we will circulate copies.  Let Melinda know if you want to see the draft copies before then (they are not available electronically)."

Subject:	RE: Huber Docs

We expect a ruling in the 336 docket to allocate receipt point capacity on El Paso, and that could be done before the end of the year.  BUT, we expect that will be subject of rehearing applications and possibly even court appeal.  And that allocation is likely to be revised if and when the full requirements/capacity problems get addressed in the other dockets in which they are pending.  So, the possibility of revisions to receipt point allocations exist even after an order is issued, and is final and non-appealable in 336.  The language in the draft agreement states that Huber acknowledges that EP's capacity allocation procedures are under review by FERC and that the capacity under contract will be bound by any modifications resulting from any FERC proceeding related to such capacity allocation procedures.  I think this is broad enough to cover all potential FERC actions, as it says ""any"" FERC proceeding.  Since we want to keep it open for future revisions, I would not advise inserting the usual  ""final, non-appealable order"" since you want to be able to track any changes that come along, however they may be themselves changed by a later order.  

Hope this makes sense.

Attached are the latest based on our discussions.  I couldn't redline the Capacity Release Agreement, so I am only sending a clean version.  I would still make a general caveat, that we still need to do a final review of the gathering agreement.  This could add to the Transaction Agreement.

Way too close to home!

Male Maturity

When I was 14, I hoped that one day I would have a girlfriend.

When I was 16 I got a girlfriend, but there was no passion. So I decided I
needed a
passionate girl with a zest for life.

In college I dated a passionate girl, but she was too emotional. Everything
was an emergency;
she was a drama queen, cried all the time and threatened suicide.

So I decided I needed a girl with stability.

When I was 25 I found a very stable girl but she was boring. She was
totally
predictable and
never got excited about anything. Life became so dull that I decided that I
needed a girl with some
excitement.

When I was 28 I found an exciting girl, but I couldn't keep up with her.
She
rushed from one
thing to another, never settling on anything. She did mad impetuous things
and made me miserable as often as happy. She was great fun initially and
very energetic, but directionless.

So I decided to find a girl with some real ambition.

When I turned 31, I found a smart ambitious girl with her feet planted
firmly on the
ground and married her.

She was so ambitious that she divorced me and took everything I owned.

Now I am 49 and just looking for a girl with big tits.

Jeff, Gas Daily has an article on DWR activities for purchasing gas.... do you know Pete Garris and is he the guy we want to get together with... or is Balwin's co. going to carry the ball. I remain unclear as to who actually is doing the gas buying..

Further to our conversation of last week... let's meet with these guys soonest.

As I have discussed with you, Citizens is concerned about the frequency of upstream supply issues that have resulted in the recent cuts in the deliveries to the Griffith power plant.  Based on the information I have received, the reasons for these cuts have not risen to the level of Force Majeure, which as you know is the only event that would excuse performance under our contract for firm delivery of gas.  Citizens therefore requests that Enron respond to Citizens in writing with a descriptions of the steps Enron is taking to insure that there is not a continuation of these contract performance issues into the future. Your prompt attention to this matter is appreciated.  "

to Enron Center South. As you have probably already noticed, things look a little different here. We wanted to orientate you to your new environment and inform you about the future technology coming on-line in the coming weeks. 

Occupancy Guidebook To Enron Center South
You will find this handy guide on your desk; it contains information concerning the enhanced printer environment, the new easy access keyboards and telephony procedures.

NEC Monitors
The NEC monitors have an internal anti-glare screen to help reduce eye strain and eliminate the need to install an additional screen cover.  Additionally, an integrated speaker has been installed on one monitor for each desk.

Turret Users
An ""Alliance MX turret quick reference guide"" has been placed on your desk; this includes important information about the new features such as ""Caller ID"" and ""Voicemail Indication"".

Increased Information Access
There are many NEC 50"" Plasma screens installed on the 5th and 6th floors.  While many of these will be displaying information designed for the specific unit, others will be displaying various television channels.  The audio to these television channels can be accessed via any of your telephony equipment.  Here's how:

Ten audio channels have been set up for access from your either your Avaya telephone, Stentophon, or IPC Turret.  The channels have been defined on Page 15 of your Turret.  To access the audio from either your Avaya or Stentophon, simply dial the extensions shown in the table below:
 
Channel	Avaya	Stentophon	
Weather Channel	12401	801	
CNN Headlines News	12402	802	
CNN Financial News	12403	803	
CNBC	12404	804	
MSNBC	12405	805	
Bloomberg	12406	806	
Financial News Network	12407	807	
CNN	12408	808	
Fox Sports	12409	809	
ESPN1	12410	810	


Wireless Telephony
You may notice the cellular phone coverage is not consistent across the floor, and some areas have virtually no coverage at all.  We are implementing a multi-network ""in-building"" system to provide consistent high quality service for the campus, keeping you in touch while you are on the move.  

Wireless LAN
The infrastructure to support Wireless LAN technology is in place and is being tested. We will be implementing multi level encryption and security to keep our intellectual property safe from eavesdroppers or hackers.

Amtel Replacement
As a move to provide a more flexible ""Plug n Play"" environment and to help with the reduced desk footprint, we have replaced the Amtel message boxes with Microsoft Exchange Instant Messaging. The Global Messaging Team is testing additional software products to provide some of the features not available with Exchange Instant Messaging; these include one-touch response keys, external LED display, and printing.  Updates will be provided as they become available.

Keeping an Open forum
We will keep you informed of the changes and developments as the migration to the building continues, please feel free to respond with any comments, queries or suggestions to  mailto:Enron.Center.South.Technology@enron.com"

Are you sending out Xmas cards.  We usually do, and we usually send a small $25 gift to our best customers (ones we make money off) and those who do operational favors for us.

There is an Enron card but it does not say Enron or we can order some.  Probably $.75 plus postage and 150 cards.  Gifts probably go to 20 customers for a cost of $500 - $600.

What do you think?

Subject:	Buffalo Power Company LLC - Gas Turbine Power Plant Project 

ENA and Crestone (Northern Border's non-regulated affiliate) met with a group of developers and Joe Meyer, Secretary of State in Wyoming, who have proposed to build a 200 MW power plant (expandable to 500 MW) in the Powder River basin of Wyoming.  Their ""angle"" is that the existing utility, Powder River Electric Coop, cannot meet the demand for electricity and the necessary distribution infrastructure to maintain the pace of development in the Coal Bed Methane BOOM that is happening in the basin.  

As you may or may not know, Enron has been very involved in this Coal Bed Methane play since 1998.  ENA is the largest purchaser of 3rd party gas in the basin and Crestone is the largest non-producer gathering company in the basin.  Crestone has a gathering trunkline located near their proposed site.  The developers will be filing a petition to remove this area from the COOP's certificated territory in the next couple of weeks.

There are obviously regulatory issues revolving around their ability to gain access to this ""retail"" market and the project would not be economically feasible as a merchant plant in the wholesale market.  However, they seem to have some political backing.

These developers recognize that they need Enron's assistance in developing this project on three main fronts:

1.  Power Marketing and Project development
2.  Gas Supplies and Pipeline access
3.  Regulatory and Transmission expertise

Given the fact that Joe Meyer is the early favorite to be the next Wyoming Governor and we are trying to work well with the State of Wyoming, and we have a natural competitive advantage in this market from a gas supply and pipeline perspective, I would like to pursue this opportunity a little further.

Therefore, I am wondering if I could get a Sr. Commercial Power Representative and a Regulatory Representative (Steve Walton would be good since he will be on the Wyoming Energy Commission), to attend a meeting in Denver with myself and the Crestone representatives sometime in the next 2 weeks.

Please give me a call and I can elaborate on the opportunity or answer your questions.  I don't want to make this email a novel!

Thanks a lot.

I will have September actuals ready on Wednesday.  Let me know if you want to meet then to discuss.

Also, Louise has reviewed the headcount plan submitted for 2002 and asked that we reduce the West Origination count by one.  The attached file shows what was initially submitted.  If you will let me know what position to eliminate, I will make the necessary adjustments.

Let's not forget the fact that Citizens has cut Enron more during the life of the deal.  The only company walking away from a deal will be Enron.  We will set up a meeting to discuss fixing the problem.

Thanks,

As I am not involved in the daily operations behind this deal, I will need your input in order to respond to this request.  As I have indicated, the frequency of cuts has caused tremedous concern and Citizens is considering walking away from this deal.  They need assurance that this gas is going to flow in order to continue.  Do we need to have a meeting?  And when can I expect a response from the desk?

Thanks,

Kim

As I have discussed with you, Citizens is concerned about the frequency of upstream supply issues that have resulted in the recent cuts in the deliveries to the Griffith power plant.  Based on the information I have received, the reasons for these cuts have not risen to the level of Force Majeure, which as you know is the only event that would excuse performance under our contract for firm delivery of gas.  Citizens therefore requests that Enron respond to Citizens in writing with a descriptions of the steps Enron is taking to insure that there is not a continuation of these contract performance issues into the future. Your prompt attention to this matter is appreciated.  "

I just wanted to touch base with you on the cash trade that you intermediated between Stephane and Cascade this morning. I don't really feel that it is Stephane's responsibility to manage Cascades price risk and I think that you are out of line for accusing him of running over your customer. If you would like we could look at doing an  MSA with Cascade where by we could sell them gas at Sumas DI.

They both wish us good luck and wanted to say this is strictly a business decision and that they would want to continue business once we get things resolved.

I know that this is a difficult time for all of us.  With everything going on inside the company as well as in the world around us, we have been carefully considering whether a holiday celebration is appropriate this year.  To be honest, employee feedback has been mixed.  Many viewed the holiday party as a unique opportunity for us to come together as Enron employees to share the spirit of the season.  Others felt a holiday party would be improper given the company's current circumstances.

After weighing these points of view, we have ultimately decided to cancel the all-Enron holiday party that was scheduled for December 8.  Given what has transpired over the past month, it could be considered imprudent for Enron to incur the expense of such an event.  I regret that this action is necessary because I recognize that your hard work throughout the year merits a holiday celebration and so much more.  We will attempt to find other, more appropriate ways to recognize your outstanding contributions as we move into the holiday season.

Ziff Energy Group Presents 

Gas Storage 2002 

Redefining the Fundamentals: 
Is Gas Still in the Storage Game? 

February 6 & 7 
Houston - Four Seasons Hotel

Power drives storage, will a recession affect plant and storage facility
development?  Will gas prices likewise continue to fall?

How can we afford to store gas when dealing with year-round price
volatility?

What's the bottom line comparison between high deliverability salt and
reservoir storage?

Will new technology improve storage economics?

What new storage projects are in the works?

Get answers to these questions and more at Ziff's annual storage conference.
Hear industry leaders from across North America share their expertise and
experiences as storage providers, power producers, utilities, pipelines,
government and energy traders. Watch for more details, coming soon. 

If your company would like to participate as a sponsor or in project
displays, please contact Debralee Fernets at (403) 265-0600 or

Calpine for their consideration. 

Action: 

Peter is going to review the assignment doc's and with Steve raise the proper 
legal document that protects ECC/ENA's interests.  At this time, Peter and I 
are of the opinion that a new agreement may be all we need but we will 
discuss on Monday.

Julie/ Stephanie/Eric....we need to discuss the numbers again. The real 
producer unwind costs may be really ugly, which basically means that our 
numbers may be too low to Calpine.. even with the counter offer, the front 
end economics are pulling a lot of value out of the deal. 


Assuming numbers can be agreed too by everyone, we are positioning ourselves 
for a package out to the producers for early next week. 

Stephanie.. one of our customers has asked for California fundamentals... 
overview... do we have anything available.  

Talk to everyone on Monday.

As you guys know our group in total is going to be made up of a few key areas.

Producer Services 
Transportation
Origination/ Middle Marketing
Trading


Can you put together in draft form a business plan for next year that 
outlines some key items. Once we have a first pass at this, we can 
incorporate into the overall package and decide how this fits in with our new 
group. 
 
The key subject items should include:  

SM/MW/BT 1> Market Overview - supply demand fundamentals in your area. 
SM/MW/BT 2> Strategies and opportunities for 2001 ( What new initiatives will 
we implement ?)
SM/MW/BT 3> New products and structures for your area
SM/MW/BT 4> Issues in 2000 ( what didn't work ?)
BT  5> Organization Issues / people /transition etc. 


If you could start thinking about these in greater detail, we can then go 
through and incorporate into the west orig. objectives. 

Call me to discuss, but we should start to discuss detail early next week.

Subject: Enron - PGT Payout Table

Brad, further to our conversation of yesterday morning, please find attached 
Enron's payout table and alternative payout table regarding the permanent 
assignment of PGT capacity. 

The onus will be on Enron to deliver long dated capacity to Calpine and we 
will begin working on this immediately.

Below is a summary of some of the key next steps. Please review and we can 
discuss on Monday the numbers and final steps as required. 

ENA and Calpine will formalise  % discount, volume grid, lump sum $ amount or 
annuity amount. 
As discussed our cost of funds implied will be LIBOR + 200 basis points. ( to 
be confirmed ).
ENA will raise a precedent agreement with option language in favor of Calpine 
which allows you to request that the period 2 volume  be no less than the 
period 1 volume and up to the total delivered volume of 67,500 based on the 
agreed to % discount as referenced in point #1. 
ENA will forward the draft precedent agreement which will include the 
necessary conditions precedent required and with the general commercial terms 
as agreed per items above (ETA - Tues/Wed). 
ENA will provide a bid to Calpine on Monday afternoon with a number on the 
Spark Spread proposal.
Contact name @ Trans Canada and ANG is Kay Coad Ph: 403-267-2480.  
  
I trust the information as provided above is consistent with our previous 
discussions.  Please contact me once you have had a chance to review.

Below is a summary of some of the key next steps. Please review and we can 
discuss on Monday the numbers and final steps as required. 

ENA and Calpine will formalise  % discount, volume grid, lump sum $ amount or 
annuity amount. 
As discussed our cost of funds implied will be LIBOR + 200 basis points. ( to 
be confirmed ).
ENA will raise a precedent agreement with option language in favor of Calpine 
which allows you to request that the period 2 volume  be no less than the 
period 1 volume and up to the total delivered volume of 67,500 based on the 
agreed to % discount as referenced in point #1. 
ENA will forward the draft precedent agreement which will include the 
necessary conditions precedent required and with the general commercial terms 
as agreed per items above (ETA - Tues/Wed). 
ENA will provide a bid to Calpine on Monday afternoon with a number on the 
Spark Spread proposal.

Subject:	Gas Supply Outsourcing (""Asset Management"") Issues   

Frank, below are my initial thoughts.  If I come up with others I will forward them along.  Please review and then let's discuss.  Feel free to forward this to anyone you wish.
Regards,
Ed  

1.  Stranded Costs are no longer a risk. 
Gas LDC unbundling has slowed or stopped.  Hence, the previously perceived market risk (i.e. stranded costs) is no longer present.

2.  Gas Cost disallowance risk is diminished.
Even with extraordinarily high prices this winter and most every LDC buying monthly index gas, there was virtually no PUC gas cost disallowance.  It was a political 'hot potato"" for a few months, but any previously perceived price risk is diminished.  In many states, LDCs are now being encouraged by their PUCs to start using a portfolio approach, incorporating fixed price, caps and collars to dampen commodity price volatility.  Such initiatives is certainly not consistent with an exit of the merchant function.    

3.  Minimizes the importance of the VP of Gas Supply.
Many LDCs have created Gas Cost Incentives and/or Transport Demand Cost Incentives to generate shareholder value.  The previously ""pass through"" aspect of the LDC gas supply function has given way to a situation where the VP of Gas Supply for most LDCs now have some profit potential.  These profits are usually necessary for the LDC to achieve its regulated rate of return, but in some cases are incremental.  Hence, in many cases these individuals have become more ""valuable"" to their organizations.    

4.  Loss of ""core competency.""
Most LDCs have created groups and empowered people to ""manage"" their commodity and service contracts for profit (as discussed above).  As such, eliminating these jobs and redeploying and/or terminating employees is viewed as a risk.  The risk is that they would potentially loose these skill sets that they think they have developed over the past several years, which many now view as one of their ""core competencies.""       

5.   Ego factor
Along with the ""core competency"" issue above, many LDC executives do not want to admit that Enron can manage their assets better that they can do it themselves.  Further, many view Enron as a competitor in cases where they have set up a ""wholesale"" trading business on the backs of their ratepayers.  Some examples include AGL/VNG, KeySpan (BUG/LILCO), NUI, NJ Natural, and PSEG.

6.  Many LDCs have standardized outsourcing.
Many LDCs, especially those who do not have Gas Cost Incentive mechanisms, have been doing seasonal (Nov-Mar or Apr-Oct or one year) RFP type partial or full outsourcing for several years.  These LDCs use these arrangements to either make money or appease their PUC and ratepayer advocate by illustrating that they are optimizing their assets and/or reducing gas costs.  However, to either mitigate the need to seek PUC approval or minimize the risk of gas cost disallowance, these standardized deals limit opportunity and/or add risk in a number of ways:
	(a)  RFP deals go to the highest bidder, most of which have little/no internal controls/discipline and are frequently dominated by origination (not trading).
	(b)  The deals are in an RFP format where new ideas and original thought is typically shared with competitors.
	(c)  LDCs often demand structures that allow them to retain most/all of the optionality, thereby reducing/eliminating the ability to mark income (i.e. accrual only).     
	(d)  Load following deals (which most all of these deals are) for only one (1) season increase the likelihood of a warmer/colder than normal season.
	(e)  The start up costs (e.g.. dedicated people, web site, special accounting, special reporting, etc.) have to be recovered over a short time frame.		     

7.  Industry consolidation
Several LDC mergers have occurred over the past two or three years.  In many cases, these mergers were done for ""synergistic"" reasons and frequently with LDCs that are served by one or more of the same pipelines.  It is safe to say that most have ascribed some acquisition value to and/or used asset optimization in an attempt to gain PUC approval of the merger.  In many of these situations, the LDCs try to consolidate gas supply across the companies and have frequently pushed to have such functions considered an ""unregulated"" part of their business.  Some of these mergers include KeySpan (BUG, LILCO and the Boston Gas/Essex/Colonial), Southern Union (PG Energy, ProvGas and Valley Gas), Energy East (NYSEG, Southern Connecticut, Connecticut Natural), ConEdison (Orange & Rockland), NUI (Elizabethtown, Virginia Gas Company, City Gas of Florida, North Carolina & other smaller ones) and Atlanta Gas Light (AGL, Chattanooga and Virginia Natural Gas).

Barry --

Attached is a report that I have access to which may be helpful.   These are actually the exercise confirmations that you should have received when you exercised.

Hopefully this will help.

This package will form part of all of your outgoing conversations with customers and will be set up in such a way that it can be customized for each customer group, buyers or sellers. 

In short form, the information package will include:

*	Supply:		Complete historicals and forecasts for WCSB 
*	Demand:	historical demand broken down by tradeclass, region, 
*	Transportation:	historical loads, basis transport values, expansions etc
*	Generation:	gas fired new gen information that will affect future supply demand
* 	Storage:	AGA's historical - by region
* 	Hydro:		Historical flows / snow pack reports... items that will affect Hydro this year .. perhaps next
*	Misc:		Summary of misc and related items that will have an effect on West gas and power.. things that drive our business.'
*	Conclusions:	Summarize all of these variables.. update and make a determination on whether are not we are bullish - bearish-neutral.

I will track down an old copy of the files that we used ot use so as to not reinvent the wheel if and where at all possible.

WHO: Phillip will take the lead on putting this information package together. Dave Fuller will assist in some of the output. 

TIMELINE: 	This should be completed in draft form by the end of the week...


We should be after a guality package that we are prepared to take to our customers on a qrtly basis as part of our customer coverage rotation.

Call if any questions. Previous packages that you think are helpful shoudl be sent into phil's attention.

Kim, I would like to use this format in our discussions with Long Beach and Palo Alto... In light of my schedule I would ask that you ensure that the material is in the format you would like.  

Also, our discussions with Long Beach are going to be around outsourcing and their performance against Socal's index... We have done some analysis of this data but not enough to bring in recommendations.

As part of our discussions, we need a section on Risk Management Services, historical pricing Socal vs Long Beach. Recommendations on some risk management products and then next steps slides. 

Our objective with both co's is to get involved in their management and outsourcing of some of their load.  I would like to pursue a proposal whereby we setup with Long beach a 3 or 5 year structure that provides both long term and short term incentives on their price vs Socal. 

I will call you on Tues. a.m.

Subject:	L-P Natural Gas

Mark and Eric,

John Malowney here in the Portland office is trying to assist Louisiana-Pacific in financially hedging their overall gas exposure.  The attached e-mail and spreadsheet outline the basics.  Essentially, he would like to group their plants into 5 or 6 general pricing regions for parsimony.  At this point, we are looking for assistance roughly grouping these plants together.  Obvioulsy, If L-P is interested in this type of hedge, we will be contacting you for further assistance in obtaining quotes.  L-P has made it clear that they wish to deal with only one point-man at Enron and John has that role.  He is currently out of the office, so you should get back to me with any questions or needed clarifications.

Thanks for your assistance.  Please contact me by phone (503.464.8122) or e-mail.

Todd A. Perry

Todd, if you're not the man that's fine but I'm hoping you are.... 

Attached is L-P's total natural gas volumes.  The plan is to financially hedge them at the various hubs in the $4.50 to $5.00/MMBTU range over a one year period.  They feel a longer time period would warrant a lower price/MMBTU.  I've listed the various states and or provinces but I have no idea as to the corresponding hubs.  I have already provided L-P with an ISDA which they are in the process of reviewing.   L-P would like to meet here in Portland to discuss our proposed plan on Tuesday April 24th.  Let me know when you want to discuss a game plan.  JOHN

Mark, further to our conversation... Mercado transacted with Enron North
America under the terms and conditions of a financial transaction and these
transactions have been or will be settled financially, however these
transactions could have been set up as physical.  The structure of the
transaction changes as a result of a few variables, including the price,day
of cash settlement, and curtailment issues on San Jan deliveries which
would then automatically convert the fixed price portion to 100% load
factor and settlement would be on 100% of the volume regardless as to what
physically flowed.

Please call me if there are any questions regarding this note.

Barry  Tycholiz
Vice President, Enron North America

Hi Mike,
 
How is everything?
 
I know That you tried getting back to me a couple of weeks ago after I sent you the earlier email, and we just keep missing each other!
 
Things move fast over here, the race season is going OK and I've managed not to kill myself yet! We have had an offer of some sponsorship in the states to race in the Speedvision Touring Car championship, so far we've got about 30% of the $600,000 that we need. I am trying to get hold of the names of some companies in th US who sell to end users (Joe Public) and perhaps are not normally associated with racing, big retailers, that sort of thing. I was wondering if you had any idea's, all I need is about six or seven company names, I can research the rest over the internet and send them some proposals via email. If you have two minutes to email them to me that would be great.
 
Cheers
 
John

Hi Mike,
 
Well, I did it, got the deal to do BTCC Touring Cars, it has a similar profile here in the UK to Nascar, but is actually very closely related to The Speedvision Touring Car Championship in the US.
 
Here's me and my team-mate racing;

We are having a very good year, but would like to do it in the US in 2002, can you give me a call on either 01625 520997 or my cell phone which is 07710 769289, I'd like to pick your brains on a couple of things. Can you believe people actually line up to get my autograph!!!! how weird is that?! Hope the family are well and look forward to talking to you soon.

Mike,

Here's the URL to the driver. I sent it via instant message but that probably won't help since you need to get the url to your house. So I figure you could forward this email to your email account that you can access from home like yahoo or hotmail or whatever you use at home.

Hope this helps.

The loss of the delivery value is about $.75/MWh- (about $2.3 million nominal).  The loss of the option is probably about $1 million.

MWHRs =  4 Years and 1 quarter Flat so that equals approximately 37,250 Hours

The difference between 102 (the new amount) and 94.5 (the old average flat amount) = 7.5 MW * 37,250 HRs = 279,375 MWhrs

I was under the impression that a 100 MW flat amount would equal $3 million value (a $16 difference between market and $21.50).  This would indicate the 102 equals a $4,100,000 valuation.  As to the discount in value due to the flexibility and delivery point I am looking to you for leadership.  If my assumptions are wrong then let me know.

Mike and Helen,
Thanks very much for attending my mother's service.  Sydney and I are sorry
we did not get to spend more time with you during my time in Portland.  I
will make sure to contact you next time I am coming into town.  I have
enclosed a residency newsletter I sent out to all of the faculty and
resident's summarizing my eulogy to my mother.  I thought it would be useful
as an educational tool as we all unfortunately have to go through this at
some point.  Please feel free to share it with whomever you wish.  One of
the things I have learned the most through all of this is the importance of
sharing.  Take care.

I want to thank everyone who has written to me via mail or E-mail regarding
the recent death of my mother.  This has been a growth experience for me.
Although I am emotionally devastated, I have learned a tremendous amount
about life in the last few weeks and months.  Since this topic is one we all
must face at some time in our lives, I thought sharing some of this would be
helpful for myself and also for those of you who have either faced it in the
past or will in the future.  It is really a tribute to my mother (a former
schoolteacher), as this was her last lesson for me.  The following is a
summary of my eulogy to her at her memorial service 4/18/01.

What I Learned:  Reflections on my Mother's Life

	1.	True Love:  My mother and I had a volatile relationship
during part of my life.  Like many people, I was very self-centered during
my late teens and most of my twenties.  I did well in my professional life,
but I was not very giving in my relationships (either girlfriends or
family).  My mother was not shy to point out her disappointment with these
behaviors and we had many heated discussions during that time period.  I
have noticed that many friends have had volatile relationships with their
closest parent.  I have learned that true love is about passion for the
other person.  One cannot be silent when you believe changes need to be
made.  Some of the hard times draw you even closer later in life.
Ultimately, my mother was right.  I am very proud of my 30s and grateful
that she was able to witness my maturation as a person.

	2.	Grief:  Of course, I have learned a lot about grief.  Grief
is 90% about you.  In the last few days of her life, there were many tears.
Almost all were mine.  My mother had accepted her fate and had a strong
Christian faith.  She was primarily worried about the effect her death would
have on my sister and I.  The vacant spot in your heart and life cannot be
measured.  It will be a wound that cannot heal as you progress in your life
and cannot directly share it with your loved one.  It will come in waves
triggered by various thoughts and activities, as if it was a neurologic
disorder.  All I can say as comfort to those who have not experienced it is
this:  When the unthinkable happens and you lose what you cannot bear to
consider losing, your life is permanently changed.  However, not all of the
changes will be towards the abyss of permanent melancholy that you assume
will occur.  There will be growth and understanding.  There will be
spiritual and emotional opportunity.  Friends and family will step up to the
plate for you.  (More on this later).

	3.	Role Models:  Like most young boys, my idols as a child were
the typical sport stars, people who did larger than life things that I had
never met.  I tried to pursue the usual goals of the young American male.  I
wanted to be physically attractive, well rounded and intelligent, and
economically prosperous.  I wanted to ""have it all"".  As I grow older, my
definition for ""having it all"" has changed.  My father is an incredible man.
He lost his left arm at the shoulder in a hunting accident age twelve.
Despite this, he did everything a person with two arms could do, and
sometimes even better.  My friends looked at him as an incredible
inspiration.  I did not pay as much attention to my mother's attributes.
She was simply an incredible giving person.  The unfortunates, the lonely,
the downtrodden never went unnoticed by my mother.  She cultivated friends
and family like a good farmer cultivates crops.  The rewards of this became
obvious to me as I spent more time with her in the last few years.  People
visited her constantly.  People called about her constantly.  People did
things for her constantly.  People prayed for her and loved her constantly.
I never would have thought that as I approach 40, my most important role
model would be a frail woman who spent a lot of time in a wheel chair.  I
will never be the same after going through this with her.  For that, I will
always be grateful.


	4.	Glass Half Full Person:  My favorite quote from my mother is
""I am having a good day"".  This was what I always heard when I would phone
her to check on her which I did daily the last year.  For my mom, seeing a
nice arrangement of flowers, visiting with a relative or neighbor, these
were the things that made life grand.  As one gets busier and busier, I
think one tends to become a glass half empty person more and more.
Accomplishments just lead to more deadlines.  The focus is on what you don't
have rather than what you have.  Perspective can become fatally altered.  I
notice the flowers more, the kindness I see more, the sights and smells of
the world more, and appreciate the life I have built more rather than
focusing on the life I want to build.  This is probably the most important
lesson my mother taught me.

	5.	Caregivers:  As a person in the medical profession, I
witness care giving every day.  However, until you have participated in it
yourself, particularly with a loved one, you have not really lived.  The
intimacy you get with the person who you make meals for, wash for, and help
with ADLs is not describable.  You develop little rituals that you look
forward to as much as the person you do it for.  It takes a special type of
person to do this kind of work full-time.  Those moments with my mother will
sustain me the rest of my life no matter what happens to me.

	6.	Priorities:  We all think everything we do is the most
important thing on this planet.  Going through this, I realize that nothing
is more important in your life than your family.  Dr. Krupski said it best
when I came into his office in tears several times needing to go home to be
with my mother this last year.  He said ""Ten years from now, you will not
remember what paper you wrote, what operation you did, what talk you gave.
But, you will always remember and treasure the time with your mother.  Go
home.""  He was right, and I will never be able to repay him for the ability
to spend time with her.

	7.	Friendships/Neighbors:  As I stated, my mother was excellent
at cultivating these relationships.  It is really not rocket science, it
just requires your time and being open.  I was amazed that she kept contact
with 8 friends from high school (50 years) till the day of her death.  They
would get together regularly.  In the modern world, this is very unusual.
Perhaps it is because we all have distorted priorities.  In addition, she
had a very tight bond with her neighbors.  I remember we had all of the
neighbor kids playing at our house regularly because of the size of our
yard.  One day a boy broke his leg (clearly an immediate lawsuit today), but
that did not stop the neighborhood kids.  My mother was on hospice months
before she officially went on the list.  It was the neighborhood hospice.
They would drive her places, fix her plumbing, and mow her lawn, all for
free.  They would bring food, come visit, and share their lives with her.
It was an incredible thing to see.

	8.	Courage:  My mother spent the last 30 months of her life
with an hematocrit between 15 and 25.  She rarely complained.  She mustered
the strength in the last year to attend my sister's wedding, her high school
reunion, and shop for holidays and decorate the house for Christmas.  She
went to restaurants with friends.  A month before her death she went to
lunch with me twice, went on a trip to a local waterfall, and went shopping
at the local center.  She did all of this with a hematocrit of 17.
Seventeen is the number I will always remember when I am tired and wishing I
could sleep but the life and job I have requires my time.

	9.	Acceptance:  How does one learn to live with the
unthinkable?  Well, I have come to understand many things.  The worst part
of chronic illness is watching your loved one slowly fade over time.
However, they are so miserable at the end that having them leave is more
acceptable.  My mother had a tremendous faith, and I know she is in a better
place.  I have changed as a person based on the above reflections, and I
understand that part of her will always live on through my life and actions.
It is a time of great emotion, but also great opportunity.  Many friends and
family come out to support you, which allow a chance to reunite past
relationships with others.  My sister and I have become very close through
all of this.  That would make my mother proud and happy.   Memorial services
and the like are all about celebration of life.  There are tears, but most
of remembrance is the honor of sharing the person's life.  I know my mother
more now than I ever did.  I have 2.5 hours of her on video to share with my
future children so they can know her too.  I am the product of two
schoolteachers.  They were awesome teachers and not surprisingly awesome
parents.  Much of what we are comes from those that raised us.  I did not
understand that before.  I do now.

Thanks for allowing me to share some of my mother's life with you.
Hopefully it will be as meaningful to you reading it as it was to me writing
it.

This structure is from Caslebridge, who are independent consultants and work with various clients to hedge their exposure. They have not told me who the client is (it is not PacifiCorp)..I think we can make a good guess.

At this time, all we would like to know is that we would consider and price such a structure. If yes, then we would like to give them an indicative no. by Wed morning.

At this time the factors 1,000 and 10 are arbitrary.

Please let me know.

Dick:

You may recall in the early part of May that we agreed as to the form of two (2) certificates which must accompany every financial transaction executed between Enron North America Corp. and EWEB.  The reasons are to (i) verify that either of Bert Dunn or Scott Spettel are still authorized (on the Trade Date) to execute trades under our ISDA Master Agreement and to (ii) insure that EWEB followed its policy of having the transaction reviewed by its Power Risk Management Committee (a copy of the trade confirmation must be reviewed by your committee as per your policy).

Kimberly Hundl will be forwarding certificates for the Transaction (Trade Date: 6/12/01) which we request be executed by Randy L. Berggren, General Manager/Secretary.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you for your assistance.

Hi Mike,
 
How is everything?
 
I know That you tried getting back to me a couple of weeks ago after I sent you the earlier email, and we just keep missing each other!
 
Things move fast over here, the race season is going OK and I've managed not to kill myself yet! We have had an offer of some sponsorship in the states to race in the Speedvision Touring Car championship, so far we've got about 30% of the $600,000 that we need. I am trying to get hold of the names of some companies in th US who sell to end users (Joe Public) and perhaps are not normally associated with racing, big retailers, that sort of thing. I was wondering if you had any idea's, all I need is about six or seven company names, I can research the rest over the internet and send them some proposals via email. If you have two minutes to email them to me that would be great.
 
Cheers
 
John

Subject: I'm a real racing driver now Mike!

Hi Mike,
 
Well, I did it, got the deal to do BTCC Touring Cars, it has a similar profile here in the UK to Nascar, but is actually very closely related to The Speedvision Touring Car Championship in the US.
 
Here's me and my team-mate racing;

We are having a very good year, but would like to do it in the US in 2002, can you give me a call on either 01625 520997 or my cell phone which is 07710 769289, I'd like to pick your brains on a couple of things. Can you believe people actually line up to get my autograph!!!! how weird is that?! Hope the family are well and look forward to talking to you soon.

Subject:	BEAVER CREEK TRAVEL

The Enron Americas Management Offsite has been scheduled for August 16-19, 2001 in Beaver Creek, Colorado.
Charter aircraft will be available between Houston and Eagle/Vail Airport - flight itinerary is listed below:
Thursday, August 16 - 5:00pm departure from Enron Aviation at George Bush Intercontinental Airport (arriving in Eagle/Vail at approximately 6:00pm)
Sunday, August 19 - 9:00am departure from Eagle/Vail Airport (arriving at Enron Aviation at approximately 12:00pm)

You have the option of flying into Houston and taking this charter flight or you can work with your local travel agent to obtain personal travel into either Denver International or Eagle/Vail.  Enron will provide ground transportation from both airports.  Flights into Eagle/Vail are very limited during the summer months.  Driving time from Denver to Beaver Creek is approximately 2 1/2 hours and approximately 35 minutes from Eagle/Vail to Beaver Creek.

Once travel has been confirmed, please provide me with a copy of your itinerary so I can secure the proper ground transportation.

Please let me know if I can be of assistance or if you have any questions.
Thanks.

Politicians from California, as farmers in this area will explain  at great length, have been scheming for decades to siphon off the  basin's cheap electricity and water.   Californians, however, have been noticeably less irritating as of  late. Having fouled up electricity deregulation six ways from  Sunday, they are skidding into the summer air-conditioning season  desperately short of power. In the last year, much of their  salvation has come from the Columbia River, whose monstrous dams are  the largest hydroelectricity machines in North America.  All along the river, from Portland, Ore., to British Columbia,  utility companies, aluminum makers and farmers have joined to help  save California - but at a staggering price. Charging whatever  California's dysfunctional power market will bear, people in this  narrow stretch of the Northwest have created a kind of Kuwait along  the Columbia.  With their record profits, some public utilities are wiring the  emptiness of Eastern Washington with fiber optics, buying diesel  generators to make still more power and paying Wall Street-style  wages to electricity traders - while making sure that their  electricity rates remain among the cheapest in North America. Just  north of the border in British Columbia, a state-owned utility  luxuriated in its California windfall by mailing out rebate checks  to 1.6 million customers.  Their good fortune, though, has come with a measure of  ambivalence and may well be short-lived. A severe drought is already  hurting farmers across the region. If it continues, utilities along  the river will have to buy power and may be punished by the same  market forces that gave them a windfall.  ""This is not nice money,"" said Alice Parker, a retired farmer who  heads a group that promotes irrigation in the Columbia Basin. ""It is  something that is offered to us not to use water so Californians can  run their air-conditioners.""  Nice or not, a whole lot of money flooded into the Columbia  Basin.  North of here in sparsely populated Chelan County, a publicly  owned utility that has two dams on the Columbia made three times as  much money last year than it ever had before. With just 35,000 local  customers, the utility last year had a $58.2 million profit. It paid  its two top power traders $285,000 each, an astonishing income in a  county where per capita income is less than $25,000 a year. The  utility refuses to reveal the traders' names for fear their children  might be kidnapped.   The chief operating officer of Chelan County Public Utility  District acknowledged that increases in the cost of power were  ""huge"" and ""obscene."" But the executive, Charles J. Hosken, added,  ""We would be imprudent if we did not maximize this market for our  customer owners.""  Next door in equally sparse Grant County, a public utility that  also owns two dams on the Columbia has made even more money  maximizing the market. It had a record $88.8 million in profits last  year - more than double its best previous year.  Grant County Public Utility District, which has just 40,000  retail customers, is using its windfall to help build a $70 million  fiber optic network for local residents. It has also bought 20  diesel generators to guard against power shortages and, if possible,  exploit the power gold-rush. The utility estimates that those  generators could add $50 million to profits in the coming year.  Like Chelan, Grant is using its profits as a kind of drought  insurance to insulate its customers from high market prices for  electricity, when, as now, local needs exceed generating capacity in  the river. Power rates in Grant and Chelan Counties are about  one-fifth as much as in New York City.  Grant County's utility has rejected, for the time being, the idea  of giving a share of its profits to its customers.   ""How would it look if Grant County gives away rebates while so  many people are paying more for electricity?"" asked Lon Topaz,  director of resource management for the utility. ""It would be lousy  politics.""  An Upside-Down Economy    The second-worst drought on record in the Columbia River Basin  has combined with California's deregulation mess to further distort  the energy market. Drought has not only helped increase the price at  which electricity can be sold on the spot market - 10 to 20 times as  much as last year's price - it has strengthened a compelling  bottom-line rationale for conservation. Every megawatt not purchased  and used in the Northwest (often at locked-in, long- term prices  that are a fraction of the current market rate) can be sent south to  California. For many utilities, conservation spells local savings  and a long-distance bonanza.  As a result, a regional economy built on half a century of cheap  hydropower has been stood on its head. Irrigation farmers here are  being paid up to $440 an acre not to farm.   Similarly, aluminum companies are collecting about $1.7 billion  this year by not making aluminum. Companies like Alcoahave earned profits that delight Wall  Street, while keeping about 10,000 workers on their payroll, by  reselling hydropower that they bought in the mid-1990's under a  cheap long-term contract.  Even residential customers are being offered a chance to make a  few dollars from the power crunch. AvistaUtilities has announced that it will pay its  customers in Washington and Idaho 5 cents for every kilowatt they do  not use, if their consumption falls more than 5 percent below last  year's level.   For utilities in the Northwest, by far the largest profits from  California's electricity crisis have been secured in British  Columbia. A number of private American utilities have also benefited  from California's troubles.   BC Hydro, a utility owned by British Columbia with dams on the  Columbia and Peace Rivers, is the first corporation in the history  of the province to exceed $1 billion in profits, as measured in  Canadian currency ($712 million in United States currency).

   A DOW JONES NEWSWIRES COLUMN                                                 
                                                                                
   NEW YORK (DOW JONES)--THE CALIFORNIA SENATE IN SACRAMENTO PASSED A           
WINDFALL-PROFITS TAX ON SALES OF ELECTRICITY INTO THE STATE'S WHOLESALE         
ELECTRICITY MARKET MONDAY AFTERNOON AT 4:50 P.M. PDT. AT ALMOST EXACTLY THE SAME
TIME, CALIFORNIA INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR INITIATED ROLLING BLACKOUTS FOR THE
FIRST TIME SINCE MARCH.                                                         
   COINCIDENCE? PROBABLY, BUT THE CONNECTION SHOULDN'T BE IGNORED.              
   ""THE POLICY DECISIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ADOPTED IN CALIFORNIA TO DATE HAVE      
ACCELERATED AN ALREADY SERIOUS MARKET COLLAPSE,"" SAID A HARVARD UNIVERSITY STUDY
OF CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY CRISIS LATE LAST MONTH.                                  
   THIS WEEK'S WINDFALL-PROFITS TAX BILL IS THE LATEST BLUNT INSTRUMENT WIELDED 
WITH POTENTIALLY DISASTROUS RESULTS. GOV. GRAY DAVIS WANTED IT AS A STICK WHEN  
                                                                          (CONT)
MEETING WITH EXECUTIVES FROM THE STATE'S MERCHANT POWER COMPANIES WEDNESDAY. THE
MANEUVER WAS LESS THAN ADROIT, AND THE GENERATORS WEREN'T IMPRESSED.            
   AFTER THE MEETING WITH DAVIS, RELIANT ENERGY'S (REI) JOHN STOUT SAID THAT IF 
THE TAX WERE IMPLEMENTED IN CALIFORNIA, IT WOULD ""INSTANTLY BLACK OUT ALL THE   
GENERATION IN THE STATE.""                                                       
   THE STATE'S LEADERS MIGHT KEEP IN MIND WHO WIELDS THE BIGGER STICK AT THIS   
POINT. CALIFORNIA SET UP A MARKET IN WHICH SELLERS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO CHARGE VERY
HIGH PRICES FOR ELECTRICITY SINCE SUPPLIES STARTED GETTING TIGHT A YEAR AGO.    
SELLERS SAY THEY HAVE PLAYED BY THE RULES THEY WERE GIVEN, AND NOBODY HAS PROVED
OTHERWISE WITH THE ONE EXCEPTION OF A FINE PAID BY WILLIAMS COMPANIES (WMB) FOR 
ONE PARTICULAR INSTANCE OF VIOLATING A CONTRACT.                                
   ""IT'S LIKE SOMEBODY INVENTED A NEW GAME, INVITED YOU OVER TO PLAY AND THEN   
CHANGED THE RULES A COUPLE OF TIMES IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GAME. THEN, AFTER YOU  
BEAT THEM, THEY INSIST YOU CHEATED,"" SAID ONE WESTERN ENERGY TRADER.            
   ALMOST EVERY ATTEMPT BY THE BUY SIDE - THE UTILITIES, THE ISO AND NOW THE    
                                                                          (CONT)
STATE TREASURY - TO LOWER PRICES HAS RESULTED IN HIGHER PRICES OR BLACKOUTS OR  
BOTH. THE WINDFALL-PROFITS TAX IDEA IS THE MOST RECENT EXAMPLE, BUT THOSE WHO   
INSIST ON PRICE CAPS SHOULD KEEP THIS IN MIND: THE ISO HAS HAD PRICE CAPS SINCE 
IT BEGAN OPERATION MORE THAN THREE YEARS AGO. OBVIOUSLY, PRICE CAPS HAVEN'T     
WORKED, JUST AS THEY HAVE NEVER WORKED EXCEPT DURING WARTIME.                   
   IN FACT, PRICE CAPS HAVE BEEN A QUESTIONABLE MEDICINE PRESCRIBED FOR THE     
WRONG DISEASE. AT BEST, PRICE CAPS MIGHT RESTRICT PRICE SPIKES. CALIFORNIA'S    
PROBLEM IS PERPETUAL HIGH PRICES. IT CAN'T AFFORD THE GOING RATE AT NIGHTTIME,  
LET ALONE THE HIGHER MARKET PRICES DURING THE AFTERNOONS IN A HEATWAVE.         
   CALIFORNIA MUST FIGURE OUT HOW TO PLAY BETTER THE GAME IT INVENTED. THE      
INSANELY COMPLICATED COMPUTER-BASED PURCHASING OF POWER ENDED A FEW MONTHS AGO, 
AFTER THE CALIFORNIA POWER EXCHANGE WAS CLOSED DOWN BY FEDERAL REGULATORS AND   
THE ISO LOST ITS FINANCIAL ABILITY TO BUY POWER. THE MATCH BETWEEN THE PROGRAMS 
AND THE ENERGY TRADERS WASN'T EXACTLY IBM'S ""BIG BLUE"" VERSUS GARRY KASPAROV.   
   ALMOST EVERYONE IN THE MARKET AGREES THAT THE UTILITIES' HUMAN TRADERS COULD 
                                                                          (CONT)
HAVE BOUGHT NEEDED POWER FOR BILLIONS OF DOLLARS LESS THAN THE PROGRAMS THAT THE
UTILITIES WERE REQUIRED TO USE BY STATE LAW.                                    
   SINCE THE DEMISE OF PROGRAMMED PURCHASING, THE COMPUTERS HAVE BEEN REPLACED  
BY HUMANS, BUT WITHOUT MUCH BETTER RESULTS. THE TEAM ASSEMBLED TO BUY TENS OF   
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF SPOT POWER EVERY DAY CONSISTS MOSTLY OF FORMER     
EMPLOYEES OF THE POWER EXCHANGE AND ISO, AS WELL AS EXPENSIVE CONSULTANTS WITH  
NO ENERGY TRADING EXPERIENCE. ONE OF THE LEADERS OF THE TRADING TEAM, FOR       
EXAMPLE, IS A FORMER PUBLIC RELATIONS DIRECTOR FOR THE POWER EXCHANGE WITH NO   
TRADING EXPERIENCE PRIOR TO THE CURRENT JOB.                                    
   AS ONE ISO EMPLOYEE WAS WONT TO SAY: ""IT'S LIKE WATCHING A FOOTBALL GAME     
BETWEEN NOTRE DAME AND ST. MARY'S SCHOOL FOR UNWED MOTHERS.""                    
   AND THE SIGNING OF TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF FIVE- AND 10-YEAR CONTRACTS
IS BEING EXECUTED MAINLY BY FORMER EXECUTIVES OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON -   
PEOPLE THAT LEFT THE UTILITY YEARS AGO TO BECOME CONSULTANTS AND ALSO DON'T HAVE
TRADING EXPERIENCE.                                                             
   GOOD IDEAS, MEANWHILE, HAVE LANGUISHED.                                (CONT)
   ""WE ARE GOING TO INSTALL METERS IN EVERY MAJOR COMMERCIAL CONCERN IN THE     
STATE THIS SUMMER AND GO TO REAL-TIME PRICING,"" DAVIS TOLD WALL STREET ANALYSTS 
ON FEB. 28.                                                                     
   THAT PROPOSAL WAS GREETED BY MANY OBSERVERS AS THE MOST CONSTRUCTIVE IDEA    
FROM THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE TO DATE.                                             
   WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO REAL-TIME PRICING FOR CALIFORNIA'S BIG BUSINESSES SINCE 
THEN? NOTHING.                                                                  
   ""THE PROBLEM IS THAT EVERYBODY IN CALIFORNIA IS 'SPECIAL',"" SAID STANFORD    
ECONOMIST AND CALIFORNIA ISO CONSULTANT FRANK WOLAK. EVERY INDUSTRY FROM OIL    
REFINERS TO INTERNET SERVER FARMS HAS HAD LOBBYISTS IN SACRAMENTO SUCCESSFULLY  
SECURING EXCEPTIONS TO THE RULE.                                                
   ""MY POINT HAS BEEN THAT IF WHAT THEY DO IS SO VALUABLE, THEN THEY SHOULD BE  
ABLE TO HANDLE THE HIGHER PRICES. BUSINESSES WITH ABOUT 10,000 MEGAWATTS OF LOAD
HAVE REAL-TIME METERS. EVERY ONE OF THEM SHOULD BE GETTING MARKET PRICES,"" SAID 
WOLAK.                                                                          
                                                                          (CONT)
   ONE OF THE GREATEST ADVANTAGES THAT SELLERS OF ELECTRICITY TO CALIFORNIA HAVE
HAD IS THAT CONSUMERS HAVE FIXED PRICES, SO DEMAND IS INFLEXIBLE. SELLERS KNOW  
EXACTLY HOW MUCH ELECTRICITY THE UTILITIES MUST BUY BASED ON TEMPERATURES AND   
THE TIME OF DAY, WOLAK SAYS, AND THEY SIMPLY SUPPLY THE MARKET JUST ENOUGH POWER
AT HIGH MARGINAL PRICES.                                                        
   REDUCING OVERALL CONSUMPTION THROUGH HIGHER RATES WILL HELP THE STATE SOME,  
BUT MAKING 25% OF DEMAND FLEXIBLE BASED ON PRICE WOULD GIVE THE STATE A FIGHTING
CHANCE IN THE MARKET, ACCORDING TO WOLAK.                                       
   BUT THAT, APPARENTLY, IS TOO COMPLICATED OR POLITICALLY DIFFICULT. PRICE     
CAPS, A WINDFALL-PROFITS TAX AND POLITICAL PATRONAGE JOBS FOR BUYING BILLIONS OF
DOLLARS OF POWER MAY NOT SAVE THE STATE FROM BANKRUPTCY, BUT THEY ARE EASIER TO 
SELL - OR SLIP THROUGH - IN SACRAMENTO.

Subject:	Our Response to the U.S. Tragedy


The tragedy of Tuesday, September 11 will serve as an unforgettable reminder to people all over the world of what is truly important and of life's fragility.  My heartfelt sympathies go out to the families and friends of all the people whose lives were taken in this senseless and horrific attack.  I ask that all of you keep our deceased colleague Nick Humber and his family in your thoughts and prayers.  Tragically, Nick, a director with Enron Wind, was on one of the planes hijacked on Tuesday.
To help with relief efforts in New York and Washington, D.C., Enron will make a total contribution of $1 million dollars to be split equally between the American Red Cross and the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund.
Many of you have expressed an interest in more personal involvement and I want you to be aware of some of the options available.  I encourage you to support those impacted by this tragedy by donating to relief efforts, and to take advantage of our Matching Gift Program to double the impact of your individual donation.  Because of the significance of this tragic event, Enron will match your contribution 2 for 1.

How to Help
?  Please go to www.easymatch.com/enron. Once there, click on ""Disaster Relief""  (located in the middle of the top of the page).  Please choose from the list of non-profits that are accepting donations to help with this effort.  Any donations made to aid with disaster relief will not be counted toward the annual $15,000 Matching Gift limit.   You will need your GIS number to do this (it begins with a 9).  If you are unsure of your GIS number, please contact the HR GIM helpdesk at 713-853-5666. 

?  We will have red, white and blue striped ribbons in Houston for employees to pin on their shirts in memory of those who lost their lives, in honor of those who survived, and for their families.  Donations to the New York Firefighters and Police Officers Fund and other organizations are being accepted in exchange for the ribbons.  Enron will also match these donations.  The  ribbons are available tomorrow from 9:00 - 11:00 a.m. at the InfoZone, which is located by the down escalator in the lobby.   For any other employees who would like to make donations, please go to the above website.  

?  Enron employees are generously giving blood, and we will continue to work with relief efforts to ensure that employees who want to give, have the ability to do so.  If you have questions, call 713-853-6100. 

?  President Bush has declared Friday a day of ""National Prayer and Remembrance,"" and is calling on Americans to use their lunch breaks to go to places of worship to pray for victims and their families.   Following is a list of websites with additional information: 

o	<http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/> 
o	<http://www.chron.com/content/community/religious/>
o	If you are looking for a service within walking distance of the Enron building, First United Methodist Church (corner of Main and Clay) and Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will hold prayer services on Friday.  First United Methodist Church will have services at 11:00 a.m., noon and 1:00 p.m.  Antioch Missionary Baptist Church will have a service at noon.  
o If you are interested in attending a service and don't work in this area, please check your local television websites for more information. 


?  For Houston employees, a citywide candlelight vigil will be held on the steps of City Hall in Downtown Houston at 7 p.m. tomorrow night.  Mayor Lee Brown will be speaking.  

?  At 10:00 a.m. (Central) on Monday, September 17th, in Enron facilities around the world, we will have a moment of silence in memory of  those whose lives have been tragically taken.  We ask that you put down the phone, turn away from your computer and dedicate a personal moment of silence together with your co-workers.  

?  We encourage all U.S. based employees to wear red, white or blue shirts on Monday.

For Counseling Assistance
?  For employees in Houston, we have an on-site employee assistance counselor in the building that you can reach by calling 713-853-6057.  If you are not located in Houston or if you or a family member would prefer an off-site counselor, you can call the 24-hour Employee Assistance Program number 1-800-345-1391. 

?  Employees outside the U.S. can also contact 713-853-6057 directly.  United HealthGroup (Enron's medical network administrator) has provided free access to their National Disaster Line for counseling service to any person.  That number is 800-268-1026.  We are also working to bring crisis counseling to any work location that has a need.

This is an agonizing time for our nation and it is hard for us all.  In addition to the financial and human support we are extending to those in need, it is imperative that we at Enron continue to safely and reliably serve our customers in the U.S. and around the world.  We know it is difficult but we must demonstrate on-going stability and strength at Enron, as this will serve as a signal that the ideals upon which America was founded cannot be diminished.  Again, our hearts go out to the families and friends of those who have lost loved ones in this tragedy.  Please continue to watch your e-mail for more information.

We are in the process of confirming that all traders are set up correctly and ready to trade when the system goes live. 

We need to make sure that your Stack Managers are accessing the correct database. In order to do this, we need to know how you access Stack Manager:

1) Through Terminal Server (the one that opens up a desktop within a desktop and it actually appears that you have two Start buttons). 
or
2) By opening the Stack Manager directly from your ""native"" desktop.

Please reply to this message with either a corresponding ""1"" or a ""2"" in the subject field.

If you're not sure which one you have, please contact myself x39673, Teresa Mandola x39807 or Jennifer McQuade x53614 and we'll come by your desk to help you.

As we discussed during our September 7 meeting, attached is a matrix
showing the 10 Northwest Aluminum Direct Service Industries (DSI's).
Since the curtailment agreements BPA has with Alcoa and Columbia Falls
are confidential, am not privy to all their terms. However, I think the
overall status is pretty accurate.

We can use this chart in our October 8 meeting to discuss possible DSI
candidates for Enron services. Please let me know if you need any more

As many of you know, I have a provision in my employment contract which provides for a payment of $20 million per year for the remaining term of my contract in the event of a change of control of Enron.  The merger with Dynegy, or a similar transaction with any other company, would trigger this provision on closing.  Assuming the merger with Dynegy is closed within 6-9 months, as we expect, this provision would entitle me to total payments of slightly more than $60 million.

Many CEOs have change of control provisions in their employment contracts and mine has been in place since 1989.  But given the current circumstances facing the company and our employees, I have been giving a lot of thought these last few days to what to do about this payment.  Initially, I thought I would use part of the funds for a foundation for our employees and take the remainder in stock and cash.  However, after talking to a number of employees this afternoon, I have decided that the best course of action would be for me to waive my right to any of this payment.  Therefore, at closing, I will receive no payments under this provision.

I know this action does not remedy the uncertainty that you and your families face.  But please know that I will continue to do everything in my power to serve the best interests of Enron's employees and shareholders.  I am still very proud of what we have built at Enron, and I want to continue working with all of you to correct the problems and restore Enron to its rightful place in the energy industry.

Thank you.

  February 23, 2001:  	Load was taken from 7 MW to 4 MW for HE 11 - 24.  Deal # 421598.1 was reduced from a 7 MW to a 4 MW (D. Scholtes).
			We remarketed the 3 MW's real time to WWP deal # 530654.1 (source PGE).  We did not enter a deal to keep LP whole.

			We remarketed the 3 MW's real time to Puget for HE 1-9 deal # 530689.1 and to WWP for HE 10-24 deal # 530716.1.
			We did not enter a deal to keep LP whole.   
  
 August 29, 2001:  	Virginia set deal # 421598.1 back to 7 MW, keeping sale to LP whole, and entered deal # 754187.1 to buy back 3 MW of LP energy at 70 % of  the 			price sold real time. (70% / 30% split according to agreement with LP). 
			VT routed original purchase from PGE-deal 529161.1 (ST NW) back to Lousiana Pacific-deal # 421598.1 (LT NW) and routed the ""buy-back"" deal # 			754187.1 (ST W HOURLY) to WWP and to Puget (ST W HOURLY).

  I think that this will properly take care of the dispute and make Lousiana Pacific happy.  Please let me know if you have any questions or comments.


  Thanks,

Day-After Doldrums

Western traders lucky enough to be back in the office the day after
Christmas were greeted by rising day-ahead prices for the Thursday through
Saturday package, largely due to anticipated load increases later in the
week.  Most parties, however, described post-holiday electricity trading on
Wednesday as ""thin and illiquid,"" especially for forward goods.  Some
players also attributed a bit of the daily strength to higher spot gas
prices.  Speaking of gas, NYMEX Henry Hub futures contracts rose sharply in
early Wednesday trade amid forecasts calling for colder weather in the
Midwest and Northeast, but fell late on a rash of profit taking.  January
Hub gas rose to a session high of 3.02$/mmBtu, before profit taking caused
prices to tumble, settling at 2.911$/mmBtu, a rise of 1.6 cents from Friday'
s close.  The January contract expires on Thursday.  February contracts
ended the day 4.8 cents higher at 2.937$/mmBtu.  NYMEX said it would extend
Thursday's session by 15 minutes to 14:45 EST due to the late release of the
AGA inventory report.  Because of the Christmas holiday, the AGA will be
releasing its weekly report at 14:00 PST on Thursday.  Early estimates were
calling for a draw of 50 to 75 bcf last week, well above the 175-bcf draw
seen last year, and the five-year average draw of 140 bcf.  Milder weather
this year has kept withdrawls to a minimum and stocks near historically high
levels.

Some Northwest daily dabblers said that Wednesday trading was relatively
active, ""for the day after Christmas,"" while others said that modest loads
and abundant hydro had most parties well covered for the three-day piece.
Nonetheless, peak power prices for the Thursday through Saturday package
rose as much as 4$/MWh on an anticipated increase in loads later in the
week.  Heavy load energy at the Mid-Columbia traded from 23 to 25$/MWh, with
most trades occurring between 23.5 and 24.5$/MWh.  Light load goods rose by
an average of 2.5$/MWh, with confirmed transactions from 19 to 21$/MWh.
Flow forecasts for Chief Joseph remained healthy, coming in at 105 kcfs
Thursday, 95 kcfs Friday, 75 kcfs Saturday, 60 kcfs Sunday, 85 kcfs New Year
's Eve, 50 kcfs New Year's Day, and 100 kcfs next Wednesday.  The latest
six-to-ten from the NWS was calling for above-normal temperatures in the
region's major load centers for the first week of the New Year.

Peak power prices for the Thursday/Friday/Saturday package firmed up across
the Golden State on Wednesday.  An increase in off-line megawatts, a lack of
liquidity in thin trading, and sharply increased spot-gas prices were the
biggest factors in the price jump, according to California market players.
Peak-hour prices at California hubs increased from 2.25 to 5.25$/MWh for the
three-day package, but off-peak hours did not necessarily reflect the
increase.  Bucking the statewide trend, off-peak pieces at SP-15 traded
slightly lower than on Friday, ranging from 13.6 to 16.75$/MWh.  Players at
the hub cited ""getting caught with power on our hands that we had no choice
but to sell.""  In the news, on Monday a U.S. Bankruptcy Court approved PG&E
Corp.'s agreement to pay off the $265 million in outstanding power bills to
Calpine Corp.  Starting Monday and continuing through November 2002, PG&E
will make monthly payments of principal and interest to Calpine.  As for
unit news, generation was perhaps the most tumultuous factor in the power
market over the long Christmas weekend.  On Saturday, December 22, there
were 4 new outages, three of which were planned.  Etiwanda #3 and #4 (320 MW
each) came off line on Saturday as planned, as did Duke's 336 MW Morrow Bay
#4.  Helms PGP #3 (404 MW) tripped off line with an unplanned outage but
came back a day later. There were two planned outages on Sunday the 23rd:
Alamitos #4 (320 MW) and Morrow Bay #3 (337 MW), the latter of which came
back on line on Wednesday December 26.  On Christmas Day, Los Medanos (550
MW) was curtailed for the second time in less than a month with an unplanned
outage, and was running at 36% of capacity as of this writing.  The Sutter
Plants (546 MW) were ramping up towards full power, and stood at 525 MW at
11:15am PST Wednesday.

Spot electricity prices in the Southwest displayed the largest gains in the
West on Friday, primarily due to rising spot gas prices, and an expected
increase in loads for later in the week.  Peak power at Palo Verde gained as
much as 6.25$/MWh for the three-day combo, with confirmed trades anywhere
between 26 and 30$/MWh.  Most deals were done on the lower end of that
range, with the highest prices seen late, when a few shorts reportedly
entered the market.  Light load goods at the Southwest hub gained an average
of 2.75$/MWh to trade from 15.25 to 18.25$/MWh.  In unit news, Mohave #1
(790 MW) finally returned to the grid over the long weekend, after coming
down for tube leak repairs back on December 15.  ""That must have been one
hell of a leak,"" joked one marketer.  The five-day outlook for the Phoenix
area called for daytime highs in the mid to upper 60s, with overnight lows
in the mid to low 40s.  ""Down here 40s seem pretty cold, and they have been
giving us some pretty healthy morning and evening peaks,"" said one Southwest
trader.  The latest six-to-ten from the NWS was calling for above-normal
temperatures in Arizona and normal conditions in New Mexico from January 1
through 5.

With temperatures across the Eastern Interconnect firmly entrenched in
below-normal territory and increasing numbers of businesses reopening for
the post-Christmas pre-New Year's slack period, day-ahead prices at all
major hubs strengthened over prices seen on Friday.  Nevertheless, many
traders were sitting out the year-end market at home or on vacation, and the
traders manning the daily desks reported few trades at any hubs.  Forecasts
for the entire East called for increased heating demand through the New
Year, though continued healthy generation managed to keep a lid on the
market's high end.  On NYMEX, Henry Hub natural gas contracts nudged up
slightly.  The January contract clung to early gains despite late
profit-taking to close up 1.6 cents at 2.911$/mmBtu, while the February
piece gained 4.8 cents, settling at 2.937$/mmBtu.

Traders at Western PJM reported very light trading their first day back at
work after the Christmas holiday, with prices for Thursday goods fluctuating
slightly between 26 and 26.5$/MWh.  LMPs likewise reflected the quiet
atmosphere on the Eastern seaboard, with power averaging 15.58$/MWh over the
course of the day. The high of 24.2$/MWh was reached between 09:30 and 10:30
EST, where actual load exceeded predictions by a sliver.  Still, prices were
around 1.25-2$/MWh higher than they were on Friday, thanks in large part to
the cooling that has gripped the region.  Temperatures were hovering near
freezing through much of Western PJM, with the five-day forecast calling for
temperatures to remain below normal plus a chance of snow through Sunday
December 30.  The latest six-to-ten echoed the prediction, extending
below-normal temperatures through January 5.  There were no reported unit
outages in PJM on Wednesday.

Temperatures were the leading impulse in ECAR markets on Wednesday, with
highs in the region failing to reach even freezing, and the latest five-day
forecast calling for more of the same plus a chance of snow or snow flurries
from Wednesday through Sunday.  As a result, Into Cinergy pieces traded as
high as 27$/MWh, a two-dollar increase on the high end, but flat on the low
at 22$/MWh.  ""With so few businesses opening over the holiday slack-time,
there just wasn't enough demand to push up prices, despite the colder
weather,"" remarked one trader.  ""But,"" he added, ""more businesses will be
opening as the week drags on, and if this kind of weather continues into the
New Year, we could see some real strength in the market.""  The latest
six-to-ten proved encouraging for such an outcome, calling for temperatures
to remain below normal through January 5.  There were no new unit outages
reported on Wednesday in ECAR.

SERC was no exception to the general condition of the Eastern markets on
Wednesday:  temperatures were well below normal, in many cases below
freezing at night, and demand was light due to the small number of
businesses open between the two big December holidays.  Prices at Into
Entergy showed modest gains, trading between 23.5 and 25.5$/MWh.  ""There
wasn't much going on in Entergy today,"" commented one off-task trader,
""Prices started out at the high end and came down over the course of the day
as some sellers realized they were stuck and had to unload.""  Into TVA
prices likewise strengthened, trading from 24 to 25.5$/MWh on Wednesday.
The five-day forecast predicted temperatures significantly below normal
through Sunday, with snow possible on Thursday and Friday.  The latest
six-to-ten likewise mirrored the rest of the East and called for the
below-normal regime to last through January 5.  There were no new units
reported off-line in SERC on Wednesday.

On the Auction Block

Day-ahead peak power prices in the Western U.S. continued to fall Monday
against a backdrop of continued bearish fundamentals.  While mild weather
for most of the WSCC provided much of the impetus for the daily decline,
lower spot gas prices and abundant Northwest hydro generation were also
lending a helping hand.  ""I don't know if prices can dip much below current
levels, but if the fundamentals hold their current course hydro could be on
the margin, and we could see some single digit prices,"" said one marketer.
Temperatures were forecast to remain at above-normal levels through the
week, with Weather Derivatives calling for heating demand in the WSCC to
average only 69 percent of normal through January 14, though some cooling
was expected next week.  ""Forecasts are calling for cooler weather in the
Northwest and California next week, but temperatures are not expected to
fall low enough to warrant any large increases in demand,"" said one
Oregon-based trader, who added, ""And even if temperatures do fall
considerably, abundant hydro and cheap gas will likely keep any gains to a
minimum.""  On the political front, U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill said
Sunday that his department was reviewing whether or not revisions in U.S.
regulations were necessary to protect investors after the collapse of
one-time energy giant Enron Corp.  ""I think the dust hasn't cleared yet on
this case and it is not clear whether the company fulfilled all of its
obligations under the existing rules,"" said O'Neill of the provisions that
allowed top Enron executives to sell shares while employees holding Enron
stock in retirement plans could not.  ""If they did [comply with U.S.
regulations], it suggests that we need rule change.  If, on the contrary, it
turns out that they didn't fully comply with all the rules, we have a
different issue on our hands,"" O'Neill said on NBC.  An auction of Enron's
trading arm was reportedly taking place Monday, though no details had been
released as of this writing.  ""We hear that there are more than the two
original suitors that will be bidding on Enron, which is good news for Enron
traders, but only the winning bid is supposed to be announced, so it may be
a while before we know all the entities that expressed interest in obtaining
the company,"" said one source.

Heavy load energy costs in the Northwest fell by as much as 2$/MWh on Monday
as mild weather cut into demand and abundant hydropower kept supplies
healthy.  Light load goods fell by an average of 1.75$/MWh.  ""It was a quiet
day, with little load to speak of and oodles of available generation,"" said
one Northwest utility trader.  There were some rumors that the 484 MW
gas-fired Klamath unit in Oregon came down Monday morning, but confirmation
was not available.  ""It wouldn't make a bit of difference anyway,"" said one
trader of the possible outage.  Flow forecasts for Chief Joseph were
slightly lower than on Friday, despite recent rains, but remained healthy at
85 kcfs through Friday, 70 kcfs Saturday, 55 kcfs Sunday, and 85 kcfs next
Monday.  Weather forecasts called for above-normal temperatures in Portland
and Seattle over the course of the week, while the latest six-to-ten from
the NWS was calling for below-normal temperatures across the entire region
from January 13 through 17.  ""The six-to-ten offered some longs a glimmer of
hope today, but it's too far off to rely upon, and the current over
abundance of hydro power would likely offset all but the most prolonged cold
snap,"" hypothesized one market pundit.

With little change in the warm temperatures projected through Friday and
plenty of supply flooding the electricity market, power prices settled lower
across the Golden State in quiet Monday trade.  Players speculated on where
prices in the current bearish spot market would bottom out.  However, with
no cold weather on the horizon, most players were pessimistic of a quick
turn-around.  ""Prices could conceivably fall to the cost of hydro.  They
probably won't, but they could,"" commented one California trader.  On-peak
goods at NP15 and SP15 traded mostly flat to each other, between 20.5 and
22.5$/MWh, while cheaper power at COB attracted a few buyers, with deals
heard between 19 and 19.75$/MWh.  Light load transactions were heard mostly
in the 15 to 17$/MWh range.  In generation news, Moss Landing #6 (739 MW)
was operating at 500 MW on Monday.  The Duke unit was derated for planned
maintenance.   Fellow gas-fired generator Haynes #6 (341 MW) was all the way
off-line for planned maintenance, with no official cause or ETR.  However,
the rumor mill indicated the unit could be down possibly until the summer.
Weather doldrums were projected to continue at least through Friday, with
high temperatures expected in the mild mid-50s to upper-60s. The most
current six-to-ten called for below-normal temperatures along the coast and
in Northern California, with normal temperatures in the southern interior,
from January 13 to 17.

Unseasonably mild weather, lower spot gas prices and returning generation
were all cited as factors that led to a softer electricity market in the
Southwest on Monday.  Peak power in the desert region fell by as much as
3.5$/MWh, while light load goods shed as much as 4.25$/MWh.  On the unit
front, Four Corners #4 and #5 (750 MW each), San Juan #1 (350 MW), and
Mohave #2 (790 MW) were all back in service Monday morning following
unplanned outages that began last week.  A six-to-ten-day forecast calling
for normal temperatures in Arizona and above-normal temperatures in New
Mexico from January 13 through 17 offered little hope for those looking for
a significant upswing in the market.

___________________________________________________________
Amid forecasts for warmer temperatures as the week progresses and a healthy
generation landscape, day-ahead electricity prices mostly softened across
the Eastern Interconnect on Monday.  Into Entergy was the exception,
rallying late when a large buyer entered the market.  NYMEX Henry Hub
natural gas prices remained almost unchanged on Monday.  The front-month
contract lost 0.3 cent to end at 2.272$/mmBtu, while March edged down a
nearly identical 0.4 cent to close at 2.261$/mmBtu.

Despite transmission work at several points on the Eastern Interface and
predictions of below-normal temperatures for Tuesday, peak power prices
floated lower in the Mid-Atlantic on Monday.  Western PJM day-ahead goods
changed hands between 25.45 and 26.25$/MWh.  Balance-of-the-week trades were
heard from 24.5 to 25$/MWh, off a little on forecasts for gradually warming
weather this week.  ""There needs to be some sustained cold weather to give
demand and prices a boost,"" said one PJM dealer.  High temperatures were
expected in the upper-30s on Tuesday, before climbing into the upper-40s on
Wednesday and lingering there through Friday.  The latest six-to-ten from
the NWS called for below-normal temperatures from January 13 to 17.

The story was the same in the Midwest, as weak demand and warmer forecasts
plagued the spot market, sending heavy load energy costs for Tuesday
delivery lower.  Into Cinergy deals were done between 20.5 to 22$/MWh,
sliding 4$/MWh on the high end.  No new outages were reported on Monday.
High temperatures were expected in the 35 to 40 degree range on Tuesday,
while the mercury was expected to climb even more by Wednesday, with highs
forecast to reach into the low-50s.  The most current six-to-ten predicted
normal temperatures from January 13 to 17.

Peak power prices for Tuesday delivery posted mixed results in the Southeast
on Monday, as arbitrage between hubs sent the Entergy dailies higher and
left TVA unaffected.  ""Into Entergy prices were driven up late.  I think
some of the bidders were buying in order to sell to Southern today, with
transmission not difficult to come by and that hub at a premium,"" explained
one trader.  The heavy load product Into Entergy saw action from 19 to
25$/MWh, gaining 2$/MWh on the low end and 2.5$/MWh on the high.  Into TVA
goods traded between 21 and 21.5$/MWh.  Traders were also relieved to see
natural gas prices up, albeit incrementally, on Monday.  Market player had
been worried on Friday that prices would fall again on Monday.  Temperatures
were expected to rise into the mid-40s on Tuesday at most major load
centers, with further warming anticipated through Thursday, with highs
expected to reach the spring-like low-60s. The latest six-to-ten called for
normal conditions from January 13 to 17.

Too Much Gas

Day-ahead peak power prices in the WSCC fell for the second session in a
row, largely on the reduced loads associated with a Friday/Saturday combo.
Several players believed that mild forecasts for much of the West and
abundant hydro supplies in the Northwest were also adding to the bearish
tenor of the marketplace.  ""Prices were really bad [weak] today, and looking
at the weather forecasts, that's not going to change anytime soon,"" said one
marketer.  ""Even with businesses and schools back in full swing next week,
the upside will be limited due to the mild weather, ample gas storage, and
abundant Northwest hydro power,"" he added.  Peak power prices began the day
weak, and continued to fall throughout the trading session.  Light load
goods were also on the decline, though not as significantly as peak hour
prices, in most cases, as overnight temperatures in many areas remained well
entrenched in heating demand territory.   NYMEX Henry Hub contracts were
lower midday on Thursday, then fell sharply following the release of yet
another bearish AGA inventory report.  February Hub gas shed an impressive
19.7 cents or eight percent to close at 2.268$/mmBtu, while March lost 18
cents to settle at 2.263$/mmBtu.  Thursday's AGA report showed a draw of 124
bcf in the U.S. last week, below most industry estimates that were calling
for a 140 to 150-bcf decline.  The same week saw a 209-bcf draw last year,
and an average drop of 147 bcf over the past five years.  Total U.S.
inventories of 2.856 tcf are 1.127 tcf above last year, and 615 bcf above
the five-year average.  Of the 124 bcf drawn last week, only 12 bcf were
removed from the Consuming Region West.  Western stocks stood at 82 percent
of full at 414 bcf, well above last year's level of 286 bcf.

Heavy load energy costs in the Northwest fell by an average of 4.25$/MWh for
the Friday/Saturday package, while light load goods only fell by 1$/MWh.
Lighter weekend loads and abundant hydropower were the most oft-cited
explanations for the falling dailies.  According to Weather Derivatives,
heating demand in the Northwest was only expected to average 84 percent of
normal through January 9, while the latest six-to-ten from the NWS was
predicting above-normal temperatures in the region's major load centers from
January 9 through 13.  ""Given the amount of available hydropower and the
over-abundance of gas in storage, it will take some prolonged cold weather
to boost the day-ahead market, something that looks doubtful anytime soon,""
said one Northwest utility trader.  Flow forecasts for Chief Joseph remained
strong at 105 kcfs Friday, 75 kcfs Saturday, 60 kcfs Sunday, 110 kcfs
Monday, and 105 kcfs next Tuesday through Thursday.

As weaker gas prices took their toll on the highly dependent California
market, electricity prices for the Friday/Saturday package softened on
Thursday, despite more off-line megawatts than a day ago.  ""The gas glut has
been a problem so far this winter, and now the plentiful rain in the north
is just adding more to the off-kilter supply dynamic.  The dailies came off
a lot late in the day, which I think will continue on Friday,"" commented one
Golden State guru, while another confined himself to saying, ""The AGA was
not good.""  Spot gas at the Southern California Border notched down another
few cents, transacting between 2.33 and 2.38$/mmBtu.  Heavy load goods at
NP15 saw action from 22 to 26.5$/MWh, with the bulk of deals done between
23.5 and 24.5$/MWh.  The light load product traded between 16 and 21$/MWh,
with the low end reached late.  In unit news, Morro Bay #3 (337 MW) was
operating at 185 MW on Thursday, while Alamitos #4 (320 MW) was derated to
100 MW.  Los Medanos (550 MW) upped its output to 150 MW.  Large gas-fired
Pittsburg #7 (682 MW) exited the grid for unplanned maintenance.  The
weather picture stayed steady (read: boring) on Thursday.  Mid-state load
centers expected highs in the mid-50s and lows in the mid-40s on Friday,
while Southern cities anticipated temperatures about 10 degrees warmer.
Little change was forecast through the first day of the new week, and the
latest six-to-ten called for continued above-normal temperatures from
January 9 to 13.

Despite some ongoing outages, day-ahead electricity prices in the Southwest
fell for the weekend combo.  Peak power at Palo Verde traded anywhere from
24.75$/MWh early, to 22.75$/MWh, and possibly lower, in late trade.  Most
players did not anticipate much strength in the days to come, as was
evidenced by balance-of-the-month contracts that were heard selling between
24 and 25$/MWh on Thursday.  In unit news, Cholla #4 (375 MW) was still
off-line with no available ETR as of this writing.  Coronado #1 (365 MW) was
expected to return on January 8, while Mohave #2 (790 MW) was sporting an
ETR of 14:00 MST on January 6, but players familiar with the unit said the
ETR has been getting pushed further back on a daily basis.  There were
reports that San Juan #1 (350 MW) was off line, but no confirmation was
obtainable.  The latest six-to-ten from the NWS was calling for above-normal
temperatures in Arizona and normal temperatures in New Mexico from January 9
through 13, while weather derivatives pegged heating demand in the desert
region at 90 percent of normal through January 13.

___________________________________________________________
As regional differences made their presence felt in the market, peak power
prices posted mixed results across the Eastern Interconnect on Thursday.
Propelled by a snowstorm and unseasonably cold temperatures, day-ahead
electricity prices strengthened at the southeastern hubs, while spot prices
at northern hubs weakened slightly, but still maintained Wednesday's robust
levels.  With warming in the extended forecast, traders were not optimistic
that prices would stay high into the new week.  On another down note, the
AGA listed last week's national draw at 124 bcf, below most industry
estimates.  Traders said they were expecting a draw of around 140, and were
hoping for a number closer to 160.  NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures
plunged on the news, with the front-month losing 19.7 cents to settle at
2.268$/mmBtu.  March shed 18 cents to close at 2.263$/mmBtu.

With the return of a key unit to the grid and a break in the below-normal
temperatures expected by Saturday at the latest, heavy load electricity
prices softened on Thursday.  Big nuke Salem #2 (1,106 MW) was back in
service on Thursday, along with approximately 1600 additional MW of power.
Western PJM goods changed hands between 26.95 and 28.25$/MWh, skidding down
almost 3$/MWh on the high and 2$/MWh on the low.  From a high of 55.83$/MWh
at 09:15 EST, LMPs declined steadily as the day progressed, averaging
22.59$/MWh through 15:00 EST.  Forecasts for Friday predicted highs in the
low-40s and overnight lows in the mid-20s across PJM.  Temperatures were
expected to remain within 3 degrees of normal through Sunday, and the latest
six-to-ten from the NWS called for mostly normal temperatures from January 9
to 13.

Amid forecasts calling for slightly warmer weather and rumors of a unit
outage, day-ahead energy costs fell in the Midwest on Thursday.  According
to Reuters, Illinois-based Cordova (537 MW) was off-line for much of
Thursday, but returned to the grid in the late afternoon, however, traders
were unable to confirm the outage.  Into Cinergy peak products were bought
and sold between 25 and 29.5$/MWh.  Daytime high temperatures were expected
in the 34 to 39 degree range in ECAR on Friday, with the corresponding lows
expected in the high-teens.  Lows were predicted to be well out of the teens
by Saturday, and the most current six-to-ten called for mostly normal
temperatures, with above-normal conditions at the northwestern edges of the
region, from January 9 to 13.

As very cold weather kept electricity demand high and despite much weaker
natural gas prices, peak power prices for Friday delivery firmed up in the
Southeast on Thursday.  Into Entergy deals were done between 24.5 and
28.25$/MWh, while Into TVA heavy load goods transacted from 26 to
30.75$/MWh.  The bulk of deals were heard above 29$/MWh.  Friday lows were
expected to drop into the frigid teens, while highs were expected to climb
into the upper-30s.  The latest six-to-ten called for below-normal
temperatures from January 9 to 13.

Subject:      DSI Chart

As we discussed during our September 7 meeting, attached is a matrix
showing the 10 Northwest Aluminum Direct Service Industries (DSI's).
Since the curtailment agreements BPA has with Alcoa and Columbia Falls
are confidential, am not privy to all their terms. However, I think the
overall status is pretty accurate.

We can use this chart in our October 8 meeting to discuss possible DSI
candidates for Enron services. Please let me know if you need any more
information.

This has been a tough couple of weeks.  I hope that these daily communications on new developments are helping you understand what's happening with our company.

Here's a rundown of events from last week:

	We executed a commitment letter with JPMorgan and Salomon Smith Barney that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  We now have received a total of $4 billion in credit lines, which we will use to pay off short-term commercial debt and maintain liquidity.
	Our Board of Directors elected a new member to the Board - William Powers, Jr., the dean of The University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas.
-	The Board also established a Special Committee, to be chaired by Dean Powers, that will conduct an in-depth review of the transactions between Enron and entities connected to related parties.  The committee is authorized to take any actions it deems appropriate.
	The Securities & Exchange Commission (SEC) opened up a formal investigation into related party transactions that have been the subject of media reports and the subject of the SEC's formal inquiry.  As I've said before, we welcome this and look forward to working with the SEC to put this matter behind us.
      Moody's lowered our credit rating one level, from Baa1 to Baa2.  Standard & Poor's (S&P) lowered our credit rating one level, from BBB+ to BBB.  Fitch lowered our rating from BBB+ to BBB-.  All agency ratings are investment grade.

Even with what's happening with our company, we have kept running our business as usual, and here's few examples to show you that we are, indeed, doing just that:

	EnronOnline did 5,866 transactions with 302 counterparties on Friday.  Transaction counts remain higher than average.
	EES signed a three-year fixed price agreement with Home Depot to supply power to 115 of its stores in California and 68 stores across Texas.  EES also has exclusive rights to develop energy management proposals for all Home Depot facilities west of the Mississippi.
      EES also signed a three-year energy management agreement with Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center's four New York City facilities.

Serious issues have been raised in the media and investment community that have put our credibility and reputation as a company in question.  We're taking an introspective look at our business dealings, our core values and our organization as a whole.  We're doing everything we can to deal with the issues that are affecting our company.

And that's where you come in.  Look around you.  Look at the excellence that you and your team represents.  That's the reason we hired you - you're the best.  Now, more than ever, work for Enron and especially for each other.

Thank you for your continuing support of our company and each other."

Here is a first cut at valuing the Grant's non firm power from Priest Rapid and Wanapum hydro projects.  We assumed a term from 1/1/02 - 10/31/05.  We assumed a price curve of Mid Columbia (thus we have included no transmission costs).  Enron also assumed a payment to Grant due on 1/1/02.  The last important assumption is how to value any ""negative firm"" power (defined as a situation in which Grant's non firm power in one month is lower than the critical year monthly figure).  In this situation we carried over the negative water volume to the next month and net is against positive volumes.  

The total value to nonfirm power using the above assumptions is approximately $68 million.  If Grant is interested in a $15 million lump sum then Enron would assume a 22% stake in the non firm hydro stream.

Briefly I would like to explain our methodology for valuing the hydro.  We took the hydro raw data from Grant on the two projects and also used the critical year assumption.  In addition we created a curve to reflect the impact of water to power prices (ie the greater the water volume the lower the power prices).  We then ran a number of simulations to create a distribution that describes the range of output values.

Jeff I look forward to speaking with you about this in more detail. You can reach me at 503-464-3810.  As I mentioned I will be out this week from Tuesday to Friday.

Many of you have asked whether you should come into the office next week, especially if there is no guarantee of being paid for time worked after today.  We want to encourage you to come to work.  We continue to consider every option available to us as a company; and unfortunately, restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options.  Your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process.

I still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy.  But you should be aware that, in general, the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $4,650 per employee.  I want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices.  Additionally, Enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing. For Enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority.

We are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue.  Of course, until we finalize those business decisions, we cannot make that determination.  I know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you.  I can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so.

While terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment, we hope to do what we can to assist them.  We will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search.  We have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in Enron alumni.  We will share more information on these efforts soon.

I appreciate your continued patience and cooperation.

A few things that I have to follow up on from previous updates:

The APB (All Points Bulletin) on Kevin Watler's bike was cancelled last
month....and the reward went unclaimed.  He found the bike himself.
Amnesia?  Senility?  We'll know soon enough.  But on the other hand, I have
had three bikes stolen in an eight week span.  So right now I have no bike,
and it's pissing me off.  I thought I lived in a nice neighborhood,
obviously I was sadly mistaken, Bike thieves are running rampant on the
Keizersgracht!  Visitors Beware......

There has been a fair amount of drinking going on in Amsterdam this
summer.....here are some highlights....

Doug, Kevin Watler and Tinhead left a club in Sweden got in a cab and ended
up in Copenhagen, Denmark.  I'm pretty sure the cab driver ripped us off,
but I was involved, so that shouldn't surprise anyone.  One plus...we saw a
beautiful sunrise.

Simon left the Supper Club a few weeks ago and was later found by Watler
laying on his back on a canal bridge and singing to himself....I wasn't
there, but the rumor is he was singing, ""It's Raining Men"".  But you didn't
hear that from me....

Three weeks ago most of the German Electricity Desk took out clients to the
Okura Hotel for sushi.  We all brought dates, my date was not impressed,
I'll tell you why.....for starters, we all got bombed on hot Sake.  After
dinner we were started on cocktails.  We all decided to go to the Supper
Club for some more drinks.  I got up to go to the bathroom before we left.
Unfortunately....I walked into a wall instead.  So surprisingly enough I got
into the cab that was going to Keizersgracht 393, not the cab that was going
to the Supper Club with Simon.  In hind sight I think I made the right
call.....(see story above about Simon, same night!!!)

Eric Pierce has been having trouble riding his bike drunk this summer.  He
recently has ridden into the tram tracks and flipped over his handle bars.
A stunt that should not be attempted stone cold sober, let alone under the
influence of alcohol.....on a another occasion, he drove his bike into a
wall.   Kathryn and I are discussing the possibility of putting training
wheels on his bicycle....I'll let you know what we decide.

Speaking of bike riding....Kevin and Missy were riding back from a bar and
it started pouring down rain, I mean pouring!  So they stopped by my
apartment to get out of the rain, I was in Corsica but Eric and Katherine
were there.  Apparently the four of them found the my robe and the guest
robes and had a ""Robe Party"".  I'm hoping to hear the real story before I
die......I'm not holding my breath.  

Shockingly enough that was not the last party to be had at my apartment in
my absence....

Missy and I cooked a dinner party for twelve people two weeks ago at my
place.  I'm pretty sure everyone would agree that it was a huge success.
Only one little slip up....Missy and I forgot to serve our guests the green
tea ice cream we made from scratch that afternoon.  But don't worry, we
didn't forget to ""meet"" in the kitchen between courses and eat the ice cream
ourselves......oh yeah, we planned that the whole time.  Anyway, I passed
out at about midnight, from what I was told the party, ended at about 3:30
in the morning.

A very similar thing happened last Saturday night, but then again all of
last week was a little out of control.  I'll leave last weeks stories
(antics) for the next update, trust me, they are worth the wait....

I have an update from the human resources department....

Eric Pierce and Kathryn Adamson (engaged to be married) moved over here from
New Zealand.  He is working on the French Desk and running the Continental
Options Desk.   If anyone remembers, they are the couple I visited for New
Year's Eve in New Zealand in 1997-1998.  Anyway, they are part of the
Amsterdam Prebon Team now....

Also, I can't believe it, but I have MORE baby announcements.....Welcome to
the world, Peter Travers, Madeline (my cousin Tammy's daughter), Alex
Chandler, and the Halstead Twins (girls, I haven't heard their names
yet)......I am very behind in the gifts department, I'm thinking I'll start
sending the gifts as soon as the kids can thank me themselves.

Also, I just planned this today.......I am coming to New York for the
Weekend of August 17th and 18th.  I have a croquet tournament on Saturday
and Saturday night.  But since I never get to see everyone when I come
home....I'm throwing a party Friday night.  I'm starting it early, so
everyone with weekend plans can at least stop by, say hello, and split if
they want to.  I'm throwing it at McFadden's (Elvis, email me right away
please) and if I'm lucky we might just have the Nancy Luca Band there....!
For all that can make it, I'll be at McFadden's (42nd Street and 2nd Avenue)
from about 4:30pm on....so please stop by, you won't regret it.

That's about it from Europe, I hope to see a lot of you one week from
Friday....!

The Boxer Rebellion

On Tuesday, Western peak power prices dipped slightly amid abundant
Northwest hydro flows, sluggish holiday demand and slightly lower spot gas
prices.  ""A lot of schools and businesses are beginning to close for the
holidays, and loads should remain at lackluster levels until after the start
of the new year,"" said one marketer.  Spot gas prices fell about 10 cents on
all of the Western pipelines.  At the Southern California border, spot gas
reportedly traded between 2.63 to 2.68$/mmBtu, down from Monday's range of
2.74 to 2.79$/mmBtu.  NYMEX Henry Hub futures contracts also slid Tuesday on
ample storage, but the decline was likely limited by colder weather
forecasts for much of the eastern half of the United States.  January Hub
gas slipped 2.9 cents to close at 2.657$/mmBtu, while February lost 4.9
cents to end at 2.712$/mmBtu.  After Wednesday's inventory report is
released, with most players expecting a 20 to 70-bcf draw, the AGA will
delay its next two reports due to the Christmas and New Year's holidays.
The next report will be released at 14:00 EST on Thursday, December 27, and
then again on Thursday, January 3, 2002.  In the political arena, Democratic
Senators Barbara Boxer and Jon Corzine proposed legislation on Tuesday
requiring more diversification in pension plans to protect other U.S.
workers from the retirement savings fiasco that crippled many Enron Corp.
employees.  The two senators also called for a thorough investigation of the
events leading up to Enron's collapse.  According to Reuters, Boxer and
Corzine said about 67% of the assets in Enron 401(k) retirement plans were
invested in Enron stock, and they proposed limiting the investment an
employee can have in any one stock in their 401(k) to 20 percent.  ""No one
who gives investment advice would ever recommend someone being invested at
67%,"" said Corzine at a news conference.  Their proposal also called for
limiting the time an employer can force an employee to hold a matching
employer stock contribution in the employee's individual account plan to 90
days.  That proposal would increase the tax liability of the employer when
matching contributions to an employees 401(k) are made in company stock.
With Congress preparing to recess soon for the year, Boxer and Corzine's
bill will likely have to wait until next year to progress, and the bill does
not at this point have Republican support.

Heavy load energy costs in the Northwest fell by an average of 75 cents on
Wednesday, as abundant hydro flows and lower demand placed downward pressure
on the market.  Light load goods gained as much as 5$/MWh on the low end
from a day ago, which was misleading since most Monday transactions took
place on the upper end of the spectrum.  ""There was not much of a range out
there today, and consequently not as much activity,"" said one
Washington-based trader.  Recent rains have continued to spawn hearty river
flows in the hydro-heavy region, but water watchers warned that if the
soaking continues, rising flows could begin cutting into maximum generation.
Flow forecasts for Chief Joseph were little changed from a day ago, coming
in at 95 kcfs Wednesday, 90 kcfs Thursday and Friday, 65 kcfs Saturday, 55
kcfs Sunday, 75 kcfs Christmas Eve, and 65 kcfs on Christmas Day.  Weather
forecasts for the region's major load centers called for near-normal
temperatures into the weekend, while the latest six-to-ten from the NWS was
predicting above-normal conditions for most of the Northwest from December
24 to 28.

Amid softer spot natural gas prices at the SoCal border and weaker demand,
spot electricity prices softened in the Golden State on Tuesday.  Heavy load
goods at NP15 traded between 30.5 and 33$/MWh, with the bulk of deals done
above 32$/MWh.  Light load pieces saw action from 25 to 26.5$/MWh, with
odd-lot deals heard as high as 27.25$/MWh.  Light load goods at SP15 earned
the dubious honor of the steepest price declines in the West on Tuesday,
falling more than 4$/MWh at both ends.  Traders said lighter loads were the
likely culprits, but were generally perplexed by the extent of the
softening.  In other news, SCE reported it would request permission from the
CPUC to increase the rates its customers pay by 18% in 2003.  The utility
emphasized that the rate hike was based solely on operating costs, and not
related to debt repayment negotiations.  SCE said upgrades on its
electricity system are necessary in the near future and employee health care
costs have also dramatically increased.  On the unit front, San Onofre #3
(1,080 MW) was derated by 100 MW on Tuesday, though no cause could be
determined.  Gas-fired Etiwanda #4 (320 MW) returned to service, and El
Segundo #4 (335 MW) was operating at 170 MW.  Calpine's Sutter Plants (546
MW) was completely off-line, down from 235 MW a day ago.  Los Angeles was
expecting high temperatures in the mid-60s through Saturday, while most
other major load centers were expecting highs in the low-to-mid-50s.  The
most current six-to-ten called for above-normal temperatures across
California from December 24 to 28.

Lower spot gas prices and weaker demand led to a general softening in the
day-ahead electricity market in the Southwest on Tuesday.  Heavy load energy
at Palo Verde ranged between 29 and 30.75$/MWh, with unconfirmed trades as
low as 27.25$/MWh and as high as 33$/MWh.  In unit news, Mohave #1 (790 MW)
was expected to return on Wednesday or Thursday following tube leak repairs
that began on Saturday, though most thought Wednesday to be a wee bit
optimistic.  Further to the north, Colorado-based Craig #1 (428 MW) was
given an ETR of ""sometime on Wednesday,"" but most participants were
reportedly not scheduling it in until Thursday.  The latest six-to-ten from
the NWS called for normal temperatures in Arizona and below-normal
temperatures throughout much of New Mexico from December 24 through 28.

___________________________________________________________
Amid light trading and continued warm weather, peak power prices mostly
strengthened across the Eastern Interconnect on Tuesday.  ""People are
closing their positions for the year, which gave the dailies a little boost,
but I expect it to get even quieter this week as people start leaving ahead
of the holiday,"" said one seasoned dealer.  Forecasts for Wednesday called
for temperatures to be about five degrees cooler across the East.  The rest
of the week was expected to linger one to five degrees above seasonal
levels.  The AGA announced the Christmas and New Year holidays would delay
the weekly report by one day, pushing its release back to Thursday, December
27 and January 3 at 14:00 EST.  NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures settled
lower on Tuesday.  The front-month contract lost 2.9 cents to end the day at
2.657$/mmBtu, while February slipped 4.9 cents to close at 2.712$/mmBtu.

As additional megawatts continued to come back on-line in the Mid-Atlantic
on Tuesday, heavy load energy costs were heard in a very tight range and
about 50 cents lower than a day ago.  Western PJM goods changed hands
between 23.9 and 24.05$/MWh.  After the usual early morning spike, LMPs
spent most of the day between 15 and 20$/MWh, and averaged 16.47$/MWh
through 15:00 EST.  ""Balance-of-the-month remains pretty soft, along with
everything else, but I bought a piece at 25.25$/MWh today,"" commented one
rueful PJM trader.  Deals for the Jan/Feb contract were heard around
31.5$/MWh on Tuesday.  High temperatures for Wednesday were expected in the
crisp 47 to 52 degree range at the major Mid-Atlantic load centers.  Little
change was seen in the forecasts through Saturday.  The latest six-to-ten
called for below-normal temperatures from December 24 to 28.

Forecasts for slightly cooler weather on Wednesday sent the corresponding
load projections a little higher, boosting day-ahead electricity prices in
the Midwest on Tuesday.  Into Cinergy deals were done from 18.5 to 21$/MWh,
gaining a 2.35$/MWh on the high end and a less robust 60 cents on the low.
In generation news, traders reported on Monday that nuclear unit Fermi #2
(1,085 MW) was exiting a fall refueling outage and ramping up to full power.
Temperatures were only expected to reach a high of 43 degrees on Wednesday,
with forecasts for the rest of the week calling for little change. Overnight
lows were projected to be at or just below freezing.  The most current
six-to-ten predicted below-normal temperatures from December 24 to 28.

Amid stronger spot natural gas prices, peak power prices in the Southeast on
Tuesday strengthened, despite mild weather and holiday-related loads.  Into
Entergy pieces were bought and sold from 20.5 to 21.75$/MWh, firming up
1.25$/MWh on the high end and 2.5$/MWh on the low.  Into TVA transactions
were heard between 18.5 and 19.5$/MWh.  ""Weather is the ringleader of the
SERC circus right now,"" joked one Southern trader.  Nonetheless, the mercury
was forecast to dip on Wednesday, with highs only expected in the 54 to 59
degree range.  Little change was predicted through Saturday.  The latest
six-to-ten called for below-normal temperatures from December 24 to 28.

Until further notice please make every effort to have your curves downloaded by 2:15-2:30 Central Time.  As you both know, there are many individuals waiting for the new marks and many decisions to be made on the numbers, so your cooperation in getting us the curves helps us to finalize the numbers in a timely manner.  If you could also stress to your traders the importance of double checking their curves so no mistakes are made and also being extra careful in deal entry that would be greatly appreciated as well.

Thanks,

As you know, Enron has signed a merger agreement by which Dynegy will acquire Enron.  We expect the transaction to close following shareholder and regulatory approvals and various conditions to closing.

Even though Enron has entered into this agreement, U.S. and foreign antitrust laws require that Enron and Dynegy continue to operate independently of each other.  In particular, to the extent that Enron and Dynegy are competitors in various businesses or markets, their respective activities must be undertaken at arm's length until the transaction has closed.  Therefore, for antitrust purposes you should treat Dynegy as you would any other unaffiliated company notwithstanding the merger agreement.

In addition, all information, documents and communications related to the merger between Enron and Dynegy should be coordinated through and approved by Mark Muller, Lance Schuler, Robert Eickenroht, Mark Haedicke, Rob Walls or Greg Whalley of Enron.  It is absolutely critical that this procedure be maintained.  To the extent that information is required to be disclosed to Dynegy under the merger agreement, then such disclosure should be approved by one of the foregoing individuals.

If you have any questions concerning this notice, please contact Lance Schuler (713/853-5419), Robert Eickenroht (713/853-3155), Mark Haedicke (713/853-6544) or Rob Walls (713/646-6017).  Thank you for your help in this matter."

I arrive thursday Jan. 31 12:50 pm on horizon air. (then taking the 2:30 
star express to whistler, arrive 4:30)

Here is an update on new developments that have occurred over the past few days.

New Board Member & Committee Elected

Today, the Enron Board of Directors elected William Powers, Jr., the dean of The University of Texas School of Law in Austin, Texas, to the Board.  Bill currently holds the John Jeffers Research Chair in Law and the Hines H. Baker and Thelma Kelley Baker Chair in Law at The University of Texas School of Law, where he teaches tort, products liability, jurisprudence, legal process, civil procedure and contracts.  He received his J.D. from Harvard Law School in 1973.

Additionally, the Board established a Special Committee that will conduct an in-depth review of the transactions between Enron and entities connected to related parties.  The Special Committee, to be chaired by Bill, comprises independent directors Frank Savage, CEO of Savage Holding LLC as chairman, Paulo Ferraz Pereira, executive vice president of Brazilian-owned investment bank Group Bonanza, and Herbert S. Winokur, Jr., chairman and CEO of Capricorn Holdings, Inc.  The committee is authorized to take any actions it deems appropriate.

The committee has retained William R. McLucas, a former head of the Division of Enforcement of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), with the law firm of Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering as its counsel.  Wilmer, Cutler & Pickering has retained Deloitte & Touche to provide independent accounting advice.

SEC Changes Inquiry to Investigation

We also reported today that the SEC has opened a formal investigation into related party transactions that have been the subject of media reports and were previously the subject of the SEC's formal inquiry.  This is not unusual and we welcome this investigation and are confident that this matter will finally be put to rest.

With so much publicity surrounding our company right now, I want to ask you to keep in mind that not all media reports are accurate or even based on factual information.  We are committed to communicating updates to you every day by voice mail, e-mail or both, so that you know the factual status of our company's situation.

We have created an Enron Updates Intranet site (<http://home.enron.com/updates/>) to keep you apprised of current events.  Please check back frequently for information and new developments.

I truly thank you for your continued hard work and support of our company.

Our natural gas business continues to benefit from effective account management and resource allocation focused on identifying and responding to the needs of our varied customers.  In order to keep our organization optimally structured and to facilitate additional growth, we are making the following changes:

Producer/Wellhead Group 
The current mid-market, origination and wellhead pricing activity currently within the Central and Eastern Gas Regions will be consolidated with the Derivatives group under Fred Lagrasta.  This will create a single business unit focused upon the needs of the producing industry within the Eastern U.S.  The producer focus in the Western U.S. and Texas will remain unchanged reporting  to Mark Whitt and Brian Redmond respectively.

Strategic Asset  Development
Laura Luce will move from her role in the Central Region to lead an effort focused strictly on identifying and entering into long-term strategic arrangements within the Central and Eastern Regions.  This initiative will focus on a limited number of selected markets that provide strategic opportunities for partnering in asset development, asset management and optimization.  This effort will continue to work very closely with the regional leads.

Central Origination and Mid-Market
Frank Vickers will continue his current role in the Eastern Region and will assume the leadership role for Mid-Market and Origination activity in the Central Region. 
 

There will be no changes to the West and Texas Origination groups headed respectively by Barry Tycholiz and Brian Redmond. 

Please join us in congratulating Fred, Laura and Frank in their new roles.

Louise & John"

Western peak power prices dropped for Saturday delivery amid waning weekend
loads, while light load prices were mostly higher due to the inclusion of
the all-day Sunday piece.  A Monday/Tuesday package will be scheduled on
Friday so WSCC traders can take off Martin Luther King Day on Monday.  While
MLK Day is not a recognized NERC holiday, it is a national holiday and a
NYMEX Exchange holiday.  NYMEX Henry Hub gas futures fell Thursday despite a
firmer physical market, reportedly due to bearish fundamentals and some
technical selling.  February and March Hub gas both closed at 2.254$/mmBtu,
down 14 cents and 10.9 cents, respectively.  In the political arena, White
House Spokesperson Ari Fleischer finally admitted Enron executives did meet
with President Bush and other Administration officials during the drafting
of their energy policy, but insisted that the company did not receive any
favorable treatment.  The letter to Ken Lay from Enron executive Sherron
Watkins has raised the possibility that the beleaguered company may be
forced to write-off an additional $1.3 billion in reported earnings.  The
cash in question was generated by financial subsidiaries Condor and Raptor,
which were wholly backed by Enron stock. In the wake of Andersen's auditing
debacle, SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt said he intends to form a new committee
responsible for oversight and regulation of the accounting industry.  In the
""too little, too late"" category, Enron's Board of Directors voted Thursday
to fire Andersen as the company's auditors.  No word yet on who the lucky
new accountants will be.

Heavy load energy costs in the Northwest fell by as much as 3.75$/MWh for
Saturday delivery, while trading in a tight range between 18 and 19$/MWh.
Light load goods, however, were flat to slightly higher, with confirmed
transactions between 17 and 18.  Some traders seemed a little surprised by
the very narrow spread between light and heavy load prices, but as one
trader pointed out, ""It's cold up here, especially for the off peak hours,
and throw in the all-day Sunday and it's no wonder why the spreads are
merging.""  There was also talk Thursday that some parties were concerned
over falling snowpack levels in the Northwest.  According to the NWRFC's
January mid-month water supply forecast, April through September runoff at
The Dalles fell to 91% of normal, down from 93% of normal on the previous
report.  Nonetheless, the report suggested the Pacific Northwest is still
likely to have much healthier water levels in 2002 than last year.  2001 was
one of the region's driest winters ever, and the January mid-month report
for that year showed April through September flows at The Dalles were only
expected to be 68% of normal.  Additionally snow-pillow data for the
Columbia Basin in Canada showed that snowpack levels are holding at
above-normal levels.  Current flow forecasts for Chief Joseph were also
holding their ground, coming in at 100 kcfs Friday, 65 kcfs Saturday, 55
kcfs Sunday, and 100 kcfs next Monday through Thursday.

Peak electricity prices fell while off-peak prices stayed steady in the
Golden State on Thursday, mainly on the usual lighter loads for a weekend
package.  ""More heating demand from the colder weekend weather forecast also
kept light load up, and there was some generation back today, cutting into
heavy load prices"" said one California trader.  In political news, U.S.
Bankruptcy Court Judge Dennis Montali ruled on Thursday that he would allow
the CPUC to present arguments supporting why they should participate in the
PG&E reorganization process.  The CPUC will have until February 13 to
present their case in support of the plan they favor.  In San Francisco
Superior Court, the California Attorney General requested that Enron be held
in contempt for not turning over documents in the state's case alleging
price gouging by energy companies during last year's energy crisis.  On the
generation front, gas-fired Alamitos #3 (320 MW) returned to service on
Thursday, while sister unit #5 (480 MW) was operating at 290 MW.  Northern
hydro Big Creek Project (1,020 MW) was producing at 68% capacity, derated by
330 MW compared to just 50 MW on Wednesday.  Finally, Morro Bay #3 (337 MW)
powered up to 185 MW on its way back from a planned maintenance outage that
began January 4.  Temperatures were expected to linger below normal through
Monday of the new week.  Highs were predicted to reach the 50s at mid-state
and the low-60s at southern load centers, with corresponding lows
anticipated in the 30s and 40s, respectively.  The latest six-to-ten called
for continued below-normal conditions from January 23 to 27.

Lower weekend loads helped to depress peak power prices in the Southwest on
Thursday.  Heavy load energy costs at Palo Verde fell by as much as
4.5$/MWh, while light load goods rose by an average of 1.25$/MWh.  Off-peak
power at PV traded between 17 and 21$/MWh, with most deals going through
from 17 to 19$/MWh.  There was little to report in the way of unit news in
the desert region on Thursday.  There was some talk of a transformer check
being conducted at Palo Verde #3 (1,270 MW), but output at the nuke was
unaffected.  According to Weather Derivatives, heating demand in the
Southwest was forecast to average 113% of normal through January 24, while
the latest six-to-ten from the NWS was calling for below-normal temperatures
in Arizona and normal temperatures in New Mexico from January 23 through 27.

Despite a slump in natural gas values, cooler forecasts for Friday pushed
peak power prices mostly higher on Thursday across the Eastern Interconnect.
""NYMEX opened lower, promptly taking the wind out of the sails of forwards
trading,"" said one Midwestern power dealer.  NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas
futures softened on Thursday, with the February contract down 14 cents to
close at 2.254$/mmBtu.  March lost 10.9 cents to also end at 2.254$/MWh

Peak power prices gained a whopping 20 cents on Thursday in the Mid-Atlantic
due to little change in the weather or generation landscape.  Western PJM
goods for Friday delivery changed hands between 22.65 and 23.8$/MWh.
Traders said February edged up about a dime, with deals done around 24.9 to
24.95$/MWh.  After the usual early morning surge and a few bumps in the late
morning, LMPs averaged 20.34$/MWh through 16:00 EST.  Forecasts for Friday
called for highs in the low-40s and lows near freezing.  Little change was
predicted through Monday, and the latest six-to-ten from the NWS called for
above-normal temperatures from January 23 to 27.

Spot electricity prices edged up on Thursday in the Midwest on a day
characterized by high volatility, fluctuating gas values, and uncertainty
about weather forecasts.  ""There were some big players pushing Cinergy
prices around today, and the near-term tanked, so I'm not too excited about
the perceived strength in the dailies,"" commented one discouraged trader.
Into Cinergy pieces for Friday delivery were bought and sold between 21.3
and 22.85$/MWh, with prices falling lower as the day progressed.  The
February contract opened near 23$/MWh, settled to 22.2$/MWh just before
NYMEX opened, and was trading between 21.25 and 21.4$/MWh by early
afternoon, according to sources.  In unit news, LaSalle (1,144 MW) was in
cold shutdown Thursday, and expected to be off-line through mid-February for
a refueling outage.  Friday temperatures were expected to be lower, with
highs forecast in the low to mid-30s and lows in the mid-20s.  The most
current six-to-ten called for above-normal temperatures from January 23 to
27.

As natural gas values on Thursday lost most of the gains posted on Wednesday
and other fundamentals remained mostly unchanged, heavy load energy costs
stayed steady in the Southeast.  Into Entergy goods traded between 19.5 and
22.5$/MWh, with the bulk of deals heard from 20.5 to 21.25$/MWh.  Traders
said February deals were going through at around 20$/MWh.  Into TVA
day-ahead pieces saw action from 21 to 22.5$/MWh.  The mercury was expected
to slip about four degrees on Friday in SERC, with high temperatures
settling in the low-50s.  The forecast looked steady there through Monday,
and the latest six-to-ten predicted above-normal temperatures from January
23 to 27.

Today we announced another positive development in our efforts to regain shareholder and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and help maintain our credit rating.

We have executed a commitment letter with two of our longstanding banking partners, JPMorgan (the investment banking arm of JPMorgan Chase & Co.) and Salomon Smith Barney (the investment banking arm of Citigroup Inc.), that will provide us with additional secured credit lines worth $1 billion.  Our Northern Natural Gas Company and Transwestern Pipeline Company will support these assets.  The proceeds will be used to supplement short-term liquidity and to refinance maturing obligations.

The pipelines are not being sold.  Enron is only using these assets for this new credit line.  Secured financing like this provides an expeditious way to increase liquidity and restore confidence.  We also have the capacity to increase this facility by an additional $200 million if we bring in additional banks to participate.

This money is in addition to the $3 billion in our credit lines we accessed last week to pay off short-term commercial debt and keep more than $1 billion in cash.

I know it is discouraging to read the negative media coverage about our company.  On a positive note, there was an editorial in last Sunday's Houston Chronicle that I want you to read:  <http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/editorial/outlook/1107504>.  This is an extremely difficult time for everyone and I appreciate everything you do for Enron.

Don't forget to read our voice mail and e-mail transcripts covering these developments on the Enron Updates intranet site at (<http://home.enron.com/updates/>).

Thank you."

On the Auction Block

Day-ahead peak power prices in the Western U.S. continued to fall Monday
against a backdrop of continued bearish fundamentals.  While mild weather
for most of the WSCC provided much of the impetus for the daily decline,
lower spot gas prices and abundant Northwest hydro generation were also
lending a helping hand.  ""I don't know if prices can dip much below current
levels, but if the fundamentals hold their current course hydro could be on
the margin, and we could see some single digit prices,"" said one marketer.
Temperatures were forecast to remain at above-normal levels through the
week, with Weather Derivatives calling for heating demand in the WSCC to
average only 69 percent of normal through January 14, though some cooling
was expected next week.  ""Forecasts are calling for cooler weather in the
Northwest and California next week, but temperatures are not expected to
fall low enough to warrant any large increases in demand,"" said one
Oregon-based trader, who added, ""And even if temperatures do fall
considerably, abundant hydro and cheap gas will likely keep any gains to a
minimum.""  On the political front, U.S. Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill said
Sunday that his department was reviewing whether or not revisions in U.S.
regulations were necessary to protect investors after the collapse of
one-time energy giant Enron Corp.  ""I think the dust hasn't cleared yet on
this case and it is not clear whether the company fulfilled all of its
obligations under the existing rules,"" said O'Neill of the provisions that
allowed top Enron executives to sell shares while employees holding Enron
stock in retirement plans could not.  ""If they did [comply with U.S.
regulations], it suggests that we need rule change.  If, on the contrary, it
turns out that they didn't fully comply with all the rules, we have a
different issue on our hands,"" O'Neill said on NBC.  An auction of Enron's
trading arm was reportedly taking place Monday, though no details had been
released as of this writing.  ""We hear that there are more than the two
original suitors that will be bidding on Enron, which is good news for Enron
traders, but only the winning bid is supposed to be announced, so it may be
a while before we know all the entities that expressed interest in obtaining
the company,"" said one source.

Heavy load energy costs in the Northwest fell by as much as 2$/MWh on Monday
as mild weather cut into demand and abundant hydropower kept supplies
healthy.  Light load goods fell by an average of 1.75$/MWh.  ""It was a quiet
day, with little load to speak of and oodles of available generation,"" said
one Northwest utility trader.  There were some rumors that the 484 MW
gas-fired Klamath unit in Oregon came down Monday morning, but confirmation
was not available.  ""It wouldn't make a bit of difference anyway,"" said one
trader of the possible outage.  Flow forecasts for Chief Joseph were
slightly lower than on Friday, despite recent rains, but remained healthy at
85 kcfs through Friday, 70 kcfs Saturday, 55 kcfs Sunday, and 85 kcfs next
Monday.  Weather forecasts called for above-normal temperatures in Portland
and Seattle over the course of the week, while the latest six-to-ten from
the NWS was calling for below-normal temperatures across the entire region
from January 13 through 17.  ""The six-to-ten offered some longs a glimmer of
hope today, but it's too far off to rely upon, and the current over
abundance of hydro power would likely offset all but the most prolonged cold
snap,"" hypothesized one market pundit.

With little change in the warm temperatures projected through Friday and
plenty of supply flooding the electricity market, power prices settled lower
across the Golden State in quiet Monday trade.  Players speculated on where
prices in the current bearish spot market would bottom out.  However, with
no cold weather on the horizon, most players were pessimistic of a quick
turn-around.  ""Prices could conceivably fall to the cost of hydro.  They
probably won't, but they could,"" commented one California trader.  On-peak
goods at NP15 and SP15 traded mostly flat to each other, between 20.5 and
22.5$/MWh, while cheaper power at COB attracted a few buyers, with deals
heard between 19 and 19.75$/MWh.  Light load transactions were heard mostly
in the 15 to 17$/MWh range.  In generation news, Moss Landing #6 (739 MW)
was operating at 500 MW on Monday.  The Duke unit was derated for planned
maintenance.   Fellow gas-fired generator Haynes #6 (341 MW) was all the way
off-line for planned maintenance, with no official cause or ETR.  However,
the rumor mill indicated the unit could be down possibly until the summer.
Weather doldrums were projected to continue at least through Friday, with
high temperatures expected in the mild mid-50s to upper-60s. The most
current six-to-ten called for below-normal temperatures along the coast and
in Northern California, with normal temperatures in the southern interior,
from January 13 to 17.

Unseasonably mild weather, lower spot gas prices and returning generation
were all cited as factors that led to a softer electricity market in the
Southwest on Monday.  Peak power in the desert region fell by as much as
3.5$/MWh, while light load goods shed as much as 4.25$/MWh.  On the unit
front, Four Corners #4 and #5 (750 MW each), San Juan #1 (350 MW), and
Mohave #2 (790 MW) were all back in service Monday morning following
unplanned outages that began last week.  A six-to-ten-day forecast calling
for normal temperatures in Arizona and above-normal temperatures in New
Mexico from January 13 through 17 offered little hope for those looking for
a significant upswing in the market.

Eastern Markets Pre-Scheduled Firm Power Prices ($/MWh)

January 7, 2002 for January 8, 2002

Peak (Heavy) in $/MWh
                 Low     Change   High      Change
Into Cinergy    20.50     1.50    22.00     -4.00

Into TVA        21.00    -0.50    21.50     -4.00
___________________________________________________________
Amid forecasts for warmer temperatures as the week progresses and a healthy
generation landscape, day-ahead electricity prices mostly softened across
the Eastern Interconnect on Monday.  Into Entergy was the exception,
rallying late when a large buyer entered the market.  NYMEX Henry Hub
natural gas prices remained almost unchanged on Monday.  The front-month
contract lost 0.3 cent to end at 2.272$/mmBtu, while March edged down a
nearly identical 0.4 cent to close at 2.261$/mmBtu.

Despite transmission work at several points on the Eastern Interface and
predictions of below-normal temperatures for Tuesday, peak power prices
floated lower in the Mid-Atlantic on Monday.  Western PJM day-ahead goods
changed hands between 25.45 and 26.25$/MWh.  Balance-of-the-week trades were
heard from 24.5 to 25$/MWh, off a little on forecasts for gradually warming
weather this week.  ""There needs to be some sustained cold weather to give
demand and prices a boost,"" said one PJM dealer.  High temperatures were
expected in the upper-30s on Tuesday, before climbing into the upper-40s on
Wednesday and lingering there through Friday.  The latest six-to-ten from
the NWS called for below-normal temperatures from January 13 to 17.

The story was the same in the Midwest, as weak demand and warmer forecasts
plagued the spot market, sending heavy load energy costs for Tuesday
delivery lower.  Into Cinergy deals were done between 20.5 to 22$/MWh,
sliding 4$/MWh on the high end.  No new outages were reported on Monday.
High temperatures were expected in the 35 to 40 degree range on Tuesday,
while the mercury was expected to climb even more by Wednesday, with highs
forecast to reach into the low-50s.  The most current six-to-ten predicted
normal temperatures from January 13 to 17.

Peak power prices for Tuesday delivery posted mixed results in the Southeast
on Monday, as arbitrage between hubs sent the Entergy dailies higher and
left TVA unaffected.  ""Into Entergy prices were driven up late.  I think
some of the bidders were buying in order to sell to Southern today, with
transmission not difficult to come by and that hub at a premium,"" explained
one trader.  The heavy load product Into Entergy saw action from 19 to
25$/MWh, gaining 2$/MWh on the low end and 2.5$/MWh on the high.  Into TVA
goods traded between 21 and 21.5$/MWh.  Traders were also relieved to see
natural gas prices up, albeit incrementally, on Monday.  Market player had
been worried on Friday that prices would fall again on Monday.  Temperatures
were expected to rise into the mid-40s on Tuesday at most major load
centers, with further warming anticipated through Thursday, with highs
expected to reach the spring-like low-60s. The latest six-to-ten called for
normal conditions from January 13 to 17.

Gas Pains

With the latest weather forecasts revising temperatures upward from the
Arctic blast predicted on Tuesday and hydropower in the Northwest remaining
strong, peak power prices for Friday and Saturday delivery generally fell
modestly across the WSCC.  ""There's simply no strength in the market right
now, with flows and generation as strong as they are, temperatures so high
and gas prices so low,"" explained one hair-pulling marketer.  Meanwhile,
market pundits across the region were on the edges of their seats awaiting
news from Weil, Gotshal & Manges on who cast the winning bid for Enron's
energy trading business, once considered the jewel in the ex-giant's crown.
However, the announcement had not been made as of this writing.  The law
firm was scheduled to announce the winning bid on Thursday from their New
York offices.  In gas news, NYMEX Henry Hub futures lost ground for the
second day in a row despite the AGA's bullish natural gas inventory report
released Wednesday.  The front month contract lost 4.3 cents to close at
2.185$/mmBtu, while the March contract fell 3.7 cents to close at
2.195$/mmBtu.  Both contracts were trading higher early, but came down in
late trading under a rash of short selling.  ""Everyone's trying to keep
their positions very short on this one, with all the uncertainty around,""
explained one analyst.  ""Prices could fall to as low as 2$/mmBtu before
long.""

Heavy load power at Mid-Columbia was the cheapest in the West on Thursday,
with deals ranging from 16.5 to 17.5$/MWh, a loss of 1.75$/MWh on the high
end.  ""Now that the brunt of the cold front is going to miss us, the bottom
is falling out of the market again,"" ventured one stoic player.  The
five-day forecast called for temperatures to remain above normal through
Saturday, followed by cooling to near-normal temperatures through January
14.  The latest six-to-ten called for cooling to below normal temperatures
from January 16 to 20.  Flows at Chief Joseph remained healthy, and were
even revised slightly upward for the coming week on forecasts of rain and
snow showers, with Friday coming in at 65 kcfs, Saturday at 60 kcfs, Sunday
at 50 kcfs, Monday coming up to 95 kcfs, and 90 kcfs through next Thursday.
There were no new unit outages to report on with certainty on Thursday, but
there were murmurings in the Northwest that Colstrip #3 (686 MW) had joined
its sister unit #4 (700 MW) off-line. No confirmation was available.

As weather forecasts continued to call for near-normal temperatures through
Monday and spot gas prices at the Socal border stayed steady, power prices
for the Friday/Saturday package softened in the Golden State on Thursday.
Peak power at SP15 traded between 18 and 20.25$/MWh, with the bulk of deals
done in the 19s, while the off-peak product changed hands from 14 to 15.25.
In political news, California's Attorney General filed a civil suit against
PG&E Corp on Thursday, seeking $600 million to $4 billion in damages.  The
state alleged PG&E Corp. received substantial, unwarranted cash flows over
the past 4 years from its subsidiary PG&E, and finally did nothing to
prevent the utility from falling into bankruptcy last year.  For their part,
PG&E Corp said CPUC auditors had thoroughly reviewed their transactions with
their subsidiary and found nothing fraudulent.  On the generation front,
Moss Landing #6 (739 MW) was almost at full power on Thursday, operating at
690 MW.  Etiwanda #4 (320 MW) exited the grid for planned maintenance.
Friday forecasts called for high temperatures to the reach the mid-50s in
Sacramento, the low-60s in the Bay area, and the low-70s at southern load
centers.  Little change was seen in the forecast through Monday of the new
week.  The most current six-to-ten predicted below-normal temperatures from
January 16 to 20.

The Southwest, locked in the grips of a heat wave pushing temperatures into
the 70s in Phoenix, posted moderate decreases in peak power prices for the
Friday-Saturday package.  Goods at Palo Verde changed hands from 17 to
19.75$/MWh, a loss of 1.75$/MWh on the high end.  Many marketers reported
very light trading at other hubs in the region, such as Four Corners and
Mona.  The five-day forecast put temperatures in above-normal territory
through January 14 in the desert region, with some cooling outside of the
desert on Monday.  The latest six-to-ten predicted continuing near- to
slightly below-normal temperatures from January 16 through 20.  In unit
news, coal juggernaut Four Corners #5 (750 MW), which was scheduled for a
maintenance outage on January 15, tripped off-line late Wednesday with a
condenser tube leak.  Plant operators decided that no attempt would be made
to repair the leak and place the unit back on-line before the scheduled
maintenance, so the ETR will be near March 14, 2002.  Fellow coal-smoker
Coronado #1 (365 MW) missed its January 9 ETR yesterday.  The new estimated
date of return is sometime in the evening on January 11.

___________________________________________________________
As temperatures continued their climb and gas held steady, day-ahead and
near-term contract electricity prices declined again across the Eastern
Interconnect on Thursday.  ""Peak power at most hubs was solidly in the
teens, which wasn't surprising with fundamentals so bearish,"" commented one
unfazed southeastern trader.  NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures were up
for much of the day, but fell late and ended down.  The front-month contract
settled 4.3 cents lower to close at 2.185$/mmBtu, while March shed 3.7 cents
to end at 2.195$/mmBtu.

Amid mild spring-like temperatures and much lower real-time prices, heavy
load energy costs slipped further on Thursday in the Mid-Atlantic.  Western
PJM goods for Friday delivery changed hands between 22.75 and 23.05$/MWh,
shedding 0.55$/MWh on the high end, but firming up a quarter on the low.  In
unit news, traders said Conemaugh #2 (850 MW) probably returned to service
on Thursday, while a Keystone unit (850 MW) was off-line and expected to
remain that way through the weekend.  Temperatures were expected to edge
slightly lower on Friday, with highs in the 49 to 52 degree range.  A
further 5 degree decline was expected on Saturday, and temperatures were
expected to remain there through the first day of the new week.  The most
current six-to-ten called for below-normal temperatures from January 16 to
20.

Peak power prices slumped for the third day in a row in the Midwest on
Thursday as weak weather-related demand and healthy generation kept hopes of
an upside in the daily market unrealized.  Into Cinergy day-ahead deals were
done between 15.75 and 19.75$/MWh, with most trades below the 19$/MWh mark.
Balance of January was heard trading around 20.5$/MWh, and the February
contract saw action from 21.05 to 21.25.  While forecasts called for about 5
degrees of cooling on Friday, the outlook through Monday predicted
temperatures to remain well above normal for this time of year, with lows in
the upper-20s to low-30s and highs in the upper-30s to mid-40s.  The latest
six-to-ten predicted below-normal temperatures from January 16 to 20.

As the mercury rose and spot gas made incremental gains, heavy load
electricity prices in the Southeast continued to fall on Thursday.  Into
Entergy goods were bought and sold between 15 and 19$/MWh, losing a painful
4$/MWh off both ends.  Into TVA prices also took a hit on Thursday, with
daily trades heard between 16.5 and 18.25$/MWh.  No new outages were
reported for the SERC region.  Temperatures were expected to reach highs in
the upper-50s and low-60s on Friday, with overnight lows mostly in the
upper-40s.  Highs were expected to cool off into the mid-50s for the weekend
and first day of the new week.  The latest six-to-ten called for
below-normal temperatures from January 16 to 20.

Gasping Over Gas

As EMR staff and Western traders trickled into work from their extended
holidays, peak prices in the Western energy markets backed down slightly
from levels seen on Wednesday.  ""Well, weather's not atplay here - there's a
lot of water for the hydro, it's cool, but not cold, and it's the holidays,""
explained one Northwest marketer. ""There's just not a lot of motivation to
buy or sell,"" he added.  Off-peak power firmed up slightly across the entire
WSCC, likely due to increased overnight heating demand, some analysts
ventured.  Other likely contributors to Thursday's softening of WSCC peak
power prices were high gas inventories and lower spot prices, according to
players.  The AGA's weekly natural gas inventory report was released on
Thursday, showing a draw of 81 bcf - a bigger draw than the industry
expectations of 65 to 70 bcf, but well below last year's draw of 175 bcf and
the historical average of 145 bcf.  Combined with the fact that current U.S.
stocks stand at 2.980 tcf, or 90% of capacity, Thursday's natural gas news
wreaked havoc on NYMEX futures prices.  The January contract expired
Thursday after plummeting 35.6 cents to settle at 2.555$/mmBtu, while the
February contract trailed along, losing 31.8 cents to close at 2.619$/mmBtu.
""I felt like I was on a sinking ship,"" exclaimed one exasperated gas
marketer, ""Everyone was yelling 'Bail, bail, bail!'""  Despite the excitement
in natural gas markets, most energy traders reported another day of thin and
illiquid trading as most businesses and all schools will remain closed until
after the New Year.

Northwest peak power prices for the Sunday-Monday package eased off almost
2$/MWh from levels seen on Wednesday.  Monday peak goods at Mid-Columbia
traded in a tight range from 22.75 to 23.25$/MWh.  Temperatures in the
Northwest ranged from the upper-40s west of the Cascade Mountains to below
freezing east of the Cascades.  The five-day forecast called for
temperatures across the region to converge on normal as the weekend
progresses into Monday.  The latest six-to-ten called for temperatures to
range from normal to below normal across the region from January 2 through
6.  Flows at Chief Joseph were revised slightly upward, coming in at 90 kcfs
Friday, 75 kcfs Saturday, 60 kcfs Sunday, 90 kcfs Monday, 55 kcfs New Year's
Day, and 100 kcfs Wednesday through next Thursday.  There was no unit news
to report in the Northwest on Thursday.

Amid near-normal weather forecasts and weak spot gas prices, heavy load
energy costs fell in the Golden State on Thursday, while light load prices
were up on the usual all-day Sunday premium. Sunday-Monday package prices at
SP15 won the pole position on Thursday, with peak goods changing hands
between 25.3 and 27$/MWh, while off-peak power was traded from 18.5 to
25$/MWh.  ""L.A. is supposed to be about 10 degrees warmer than load centers
farther north so weather's probably not a factor, but New Year's loads are
usually higher, particularly in Pasadena with the Rose Bowl and all,""
speculated one California player.  Another added that liquidity was still
affecting the market on Thursday.  Spot natural gas prices at the Southern
California border followed the general trend when they slipped 23 cents,
trading between 2.52 and 2.57$/mmBtu.  In generation news, gas-fired Moss
Landing #6 (739 MW) returned to service on Thursday.  The unit has been down
since December 19 for unplanned maintenance.  Los Medanos (550 MW) was
operating at 125 MW, down from Wednesday's level of 200 MW.  Additionally,
there was an extra 640 MW off-line on Thursday from units with a capacity
less than 250 MW.  On the weather front, the outlook was less than exciting,
with temperatures across the state expected to linger within five degrees of
normal through Monday.  Overnight lows were forecast uniformly in the
mid-40s.  The latest six-to-ten from the NWS called for above-normal
temperatures from January 2 to 6.

Not even sustained below-normal temperatures could prop up power prices for
peak goods in the Southwest on Thursday against the gas-led tumble that
rattled the WSCC.  Peak goods at Palo Verde traded in a dollar range from 25
to 26$/MWh, a softening of 4$/MWh on the high end.  Temperatures were normal
to below normal across the region, and one couldn't even break a sweat in
Phoenix on Thursday.  The five-day forecast called for temperatures to heat
up on average, but they were still not expected to warm into above-normal
territory.  The latest six-to-ten predicted temperatures to remain normal or
below normal through January 6.  Nary a murmur was heard of unit outages in
the region on Thursday.

As natural gas prices dropped considerably and below-normal temperatures
reigned supreme, peak power prices for Friday delivery settled lower across
the Eastern Interconnect.  ""The Jan/Feb contract came off a lot today, but
otherwise there wasn't much interest or liquidity in the market,"" commented
one southern trader.  The AGA's weekly inventory report listed an 81 bcf
draw on Thursday, above most industry forecasts of 65 to 70 bcf.  NYMEX
Henry Hub futures were unable to sustain recent gains, and slipped
substantially.  On its last day of trading, the January contract sunk like a
stone, losing a traumatic 35.6 cents to close at 2.555$/mmBtu.  February
fell an equally depressing 31.8 cents to end at 2.619$/mmBtu.

Despite a new unit outage and continued cold weather, day-ahead electricity
prices edged down in the Mid-Atlantic on Thursday.  According to sources,
Indian Point #2 tripped off-line sometime Wednesday and remained down on
Thursday.  Some traders speculated the unit would be back up Saturday,
December 29.  Western PJM daily goods changed hands between 25.5 and
26.35$/MWh.  ""Someone was buying a lot of power early so prices were strong,
but after that they fell.  There was some West to East congestion which kept
them from dropping too much and the real-time number was also robust,""
summed up one PJM player.  LMPs lingered above 40$/MWh for two hours in the
late morning, but were averaging 25.85$/MWh through 15:00 EST.  The five-day
weather outlook predicted sustained below-normal temperatures through
Monday, with highs uniformly expected in the mid-30s across PJM.  The latest
six-to-ten called for below-normal temperatures from January 2 to 6.

Forecasts for bitterly cold temperatures by the weekend cheered Midwestern
sellers, but despite the good news heavy load energy costs for Friday
delivery slumped on Thursday.  Into Cinergy pieces traded between 19 and
21.5$/MWh, losing a painful 5.5$/MWh off the high end and 3$/MWh off the
low.  ""Load forecasts for the new week are higher, so we should see some
strength on Friday,"" opined one trader, while another said, ""I think people
will keep the thermostat up and their gas fireplaces crackling over New Year
's.""  No new curtailment information was available on Thursday.  High
temperatures were expected in the low-20s to high-teens by Saturday, with
little change expected through Monday.  The most current six-to-ten
predicted below-normal temperatures from January 2 to 6.

Amid much weaker natural gas prices, peak electricity prices tumbled in the
Southeast on Thursday.  Into Entergy deals were done from 21 to 22.5$/MWh,
with the bulk of transactions seen nearer the high end.  Into TVA prices
were heard between 20 and 20.5$/MWh, losing at least 4$/MWh off both ends,
while traders said the hub was very illiquid.  Friday forecasts predicted
slightly below-normal temperatures, with overnight lows in the 28 to 34
degree range.  Substantial cooling was expected by Sunday and Monday, with
lows predicted in the mid-20s across the entire region.  The latest
six-to-ten called for below-normal temperatures from January 2 to 6.

Andersen Partners Feel the Heat

Day-ahead peak power prices continued to rise in the Western U.S. Tuesday
amid expectations of stronger weather-related demand and higher natural gas
values.  Some parties also believed that an increase in the amount of
off-line generation had something to do with strengthening the daily market.
Not surprisingly, the real talk of the town on Tuesday surrounded the
ongoing Enron saga.  Enron Corp and Swiss bank UBS Warburg detailed their
agreement on Tuesday to split profits from Enron's trading business.  Under
the terms of the deal, UBS would take over the unit and pay Enron 33 percent
of profits for up to 10 years.  The deal give UBS the right to buy one-third
of Enron's royalty interest in the third year of the deal based on the
previous year's profit.  UBS could buy another third in year four, and the
final third in year five.  The deal still requires approval from Judge
Arthur Gonzales of federal bankruptcy court, which may come at a hearing
scheduled for Friday.  While this was good news for some Enron employees, it
was not all roses for the one-time energy-trading giant on Tuesday.  The
NYSE suspended trading of Enron shares and related securities while it
worked to ""delist"" the stock because of the ""expected protracted nature"" of
Enron's bankruptcy case and the impact it will have on the company's
stockholders.  In our ""if I'm going down, I'm taking you with me"" category,
Andersen fired David Duncan, the lead partner for the Enron audit, on
Tuesday for his alleged role in destroying documents related to its review
of Enorn Corp.'s books.  Andersen said thousands of emails and large numbers
of paper documents related to Enron were destroyed shortly after Duncan
learned on October 23 of a an SEC request for information on the audit of
Enron.  Duncan was scheduled to meet with congressional members on
Wednesday.  In addition to the firing of Duncan, Andersen said it put three
other partners involved in Enron's audit on leave, and four Houston-based
partners were relieved of their management responsibilities.  One market
analyst said of the Enron-Andersen fiasco, ""People are going to go to jail
over all this, but they'll be in good company.""

Peak power prices rose by an average of 75 cents in the Northwest on
Tuesday, largely the result of rising heating demand.  ""Our in-house
forecaster is now saying that the cold weather is going to be more severe
and more prolonged than previously expected,"" claimed one Northwest utility
trader.  Meanwhile, the latest six-to-ten from the NWS continued to call for
below-normal temperatures across the entire region through January 25.  Flow
forecasts for Chief Joseph were revised upward on Tuesday, which surprised
several players since colder weather typically means less runoff and side
flows.  Flows were projected to be 110 kcfs through Thursday, 100 kcfs
Friday, 65 kcfs Saturday, 55 kcfs Sunday, 100 kcfs Monday, and 95 kcfs next
Tuesday.  In unit news, Bridger #3 (520 MW) was reportedly back in service
Tuesday, but the returning megawatts were more than offset by a tube leak
outage that occurred at Colstrip #4 (700 MW).  An official ETR for the
Montana-based Colstrip unit could not be obtained, but was presumed to be
between 48 and 72 hours.

Amid stronger natural gas prices at the Southern California border and
colder weather across the state, day-ahead electricity prices strengthened
across the Golden State on Tuesday.  ""Outages are on the rise and the
extended forecasts still look cold,"" explained one California utility
trader.  Peak power deals at NP15 were done from 25 to 28$/MWh, and
balance-of-January contracts were heard from 25.25 to 26.25$/MWh.  SP15
goods for Wednesday delivery were priced below NP15 deals, but by less than
a buck, and BOM was quoted at 26$/MWh.  On the generation front, nuclear
unit Diablo Canyon #2 (1,087 MW) was operating at 50% capacity on Tuesday
for maintenance on the secondary or non-nuclear side of the plant.  It was
expected to ramp back up to full power sometime over the weekend.  As for
gas units, Encina #5 (332 MW) was generating at 290 MW, on its way back from
a planned maintenance outage that started January 11, and Etiwanda #3 (320
MW) powered up to 150 MW, returning from an outage that began December 22.
Temperature forecasts called for highs to reach 64 degrees on Wednesday at
southern load centers, while highs in the mid-50s and upper-40s were
expected at mid-state.  Temperatures were expected to stay two to six
degrees below normal through Saturday, and the latest six-to-ten called for
continued below-normal conditions from January 21 to 25.

Cooler weather and rising spot gas prices gave the daily electricity market
in the Southwest a lift on Tuesday.  Peak power at Palo Verde traded from
23.95 to 27.5$/MWh, with the bulk of transactions heard between 25.75 and
26$/MWh.  According to Weather Derivatives, heating demand in the desert
region was forecast to average 116 percent of normal through January 22,
while the latest six-to-ten from the NWS calling for a combination of normal
and below-normal temperatures from January 21 through 25.  In unit news, San
Juan #4 (534 MW) was having trouble retuning from tube-leak repairs that
began on January 10.  The New Mexico-based thermal unit had reportedly
ramped up to about 75 percent of capacity, but an ETR to full was not
available as of this writing.

Amid stronger natural gas values, average peak power prices firmed up across
the Eastern Interconnect again on Tuesday. ""Crude oil prices were up today
which in turn drove natural gas higher, and the dailies rallied on gas
support, especially in the Southeast,"" commented one much-encouraged
marketer.  NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures settled higher.  February
climbed 4.1 cents to end at 2.291$/mmBtu, while March gained 3.3 cents to
close at 2.273$/mmBtu.

On the assumption of healthier generation, heavy load energy costs slipped
by less than a dollar in the Mid-Atlantic on Tuesday.  ""I'm hearing the
Keystone unit is back, and the Salem outage should be over as well,"" said
one usually accurate PJM source.  Western PJM goods for Wednesday delivery
traded between 22.8 and 23.05$/MWh, and the February contract saw action
from 24.5 to 24.7$/MWh, losing about a dime to a day ago.  The NRC
admonished the operators of Pennsylvania-based nuke Limerick #2 (1,115 MW)
for not having sufficient safety measures in place for a worn-out relief
valve.  The NRC gave the problem a ""white"" rating, their second lowest
classification indicating a low to moderate safety violation, but said they
may conduct further inspections at the plant.  There was no word yet on when
the unit would be off-line for the repair.  Real-time prices were lower on
Tuesday, and averaged 19.85$/MWh through 15:00 EST.  The mercury was
expected to dip on Wednesday, with high temperatures anticipated in the
low-to-mid-40s and low temperatures at or near freezing.  The most current
six-to-ten from the NWS predicted above-normal temperatures from January 21
to 25.

As weather forecasts for Wednesday projected temperatures about five degrees
above normal, day-ahead peak electricity prices edged up in the Midwest on
Tuesday.  Into Cinergy deals were done between 17.75 and 18.75$/MWh, picking
up a quarter on the high end and almost two dollars on the low.  February
saw action from 20.2 to 20.65$/MWh, with the vast majority of deals done at
20.5$/MWh.  In unit news, traders said Cook #2 (1,090 MW) was expected to
exit the grid on Friday for a refueling outage.  The unit has been powering
down since last Wednesday.  High temperatures on Wednesday were forecast to
be in the upper-30s, and corresponding lows were expected in the mid-20s.
The latest six-to-ten called for mostly above-normal conditions, with normal
temperatures in Michigan and Indiana, from January 21 to 25.

With long-awaited strength in the gas market, peak power prices rose in the
Southeast on Tuesday.  Into Entergy deals were heard from 18.95 to
22.35$/MWh.  Traders said the front-month contract rallied, driven mostly by
the dailies, with transactions completed between 19.3 and 19.6$/MWh.  Into
TVA pieces were bought and sold from 20 to 21.5$/MWh.  Temperatures were
expected near normal to slightly above normal through Saturday, with lows
only forecast in the upper-30s to low-40s.  The most current six-to-ten
called for above-normal temperatures from January 21 to 25.

This morning Enron took a series of actions designed to stabilize our situation and preserve the value in our businesses:

-- We filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Contrary to popular belief, this does not mean we are out of business. What it does mean is that we have entered into a court-supervised process by which we can continue to operate most of our businesses, reorganize our finances, and explore various strategic, operational and financial alternatives, including the sale of non-core assets, in an orderly manner.


-- In connection with our filing for Chapter 11 reorganization, Enron is in active discussions with leading financial institutions for debtor-in-possession (DIP) financing and expects to complete these discussions shortly. Upon the completion and court approval of these arrangements, the new funding will be available immediately on an interim basis to supplement Enron's existing capital and help the Company fulfill obligations associated with operating its business, including its employee payroll and payments to vendors for goods and services provided on or after today's filing.

-- We filed a lawsuit against Dynegy, alleging breach of contract and other causes of action for Dynegy's wrongful termination of our proposed merger. We are asking the court for damages of not less than $10 billion.

-- We also announced this morning that we are in active discussions with various leading financial institutions about providing financial support to recapitalize and revitalize the company's wholesale energy trading operations under a new ownership structure. As contemplated, this recapitalized entity will be staffed with people from Enron's current wholesale energy trading team, and will conduct counterparty transactions through EnronOnline.

These are the first steps in a strategic restructuring process that will allow Enron to meet its obligations to its creditors and preserve the value in our core wholesale energy trading business. From an operational standpoint, our energy businesses - including our pipelines, utilities and other energy assets - are conducting safe and normal operations around the world, and will continue to do so.

As you know, the second and unavoidable part of our restructuring is to improve our financial position by implementing a comprehensive cost-savings program. This will entail a significant reduction in our work force. This is painful for all of us and our goal is for as many of you as is possible to know where you stand by the end of the day Tuesday, though in some cases notification will take longer.

For our friends and colleagues who will lose their jobs as part of this process, you will remain on the company payroll for now. In addition, we will submit a severance pay plan to the Bankruptcy Court for approval. This approval must be received before we can begin paying severance benefits. We will be providing more information about this plan as soon as the Court has made its determination.

I know these actions raise new questions about our company's future and what this means for each of us. Your business unit leader will be holding floor meetings on Monday to discuss these events with you. In addition, you can access a copy of the press release on  <http://home.enron.com/>. We will also have a Q&A and other materials for you on Monday. While there is a great deal we simply don't know yet, we hope these materials will help answer at least some of your questions.

When decisions are made affecting our company, people, and operations, we will let you know as quickly as possible. There is still considerable value and opportunity in our business. The strategic restructuring process that we are beginning will allow us to preserve that value and those opportunities.

On behalf of the Board and entire management team, we greatly appreciate your patience, your professionalism and whatever support you can offer each other as we navigate through these tough times to a better future.

Ken"

By Bryan Lee
  
11/08/2001 
Dow Jones Energy Service 
(Copyright (c) 2001, Dow Jones & Company, Inc.) 


OF DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 

   
WASHINGTON -(Dow Jones)- Any merger deal that may emerge between Dynegy Inc. (DYN) and Enron Corp. (ENE) will face a complicated and time-consuming regulatory-review process, legal experts said Thursday.

Any equity deal would require approvals from numerous U.S. federal regulatory agencies and state utility regulators, as well as survive Canadian and European antitrust reviews, energy attorneys contacted by Dow Jones Newswires said. 


A merger would require approvals from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Securities and Exchange Commission, Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission. And the Illinois Commerce Commission likely would weigh into the mix, since Dynegy owns Illinova's Illinois Power Co. 


Any effort to strike a deal quickly also could be complicated by Enron's ownership of Portland General Electric Co. While Enron has entered into an agreement to sell the utility to Northwest Natural Gas Co. (NWN), a previous attempt to sell the company fell through because of regulatory complications. 


A key issue for federal regulators scrutinizing a potential Enron-Dynegy merger will be the degree of electricity market concentration such a transaction would entail, the attorneys said. 


Financially wounded Enron is the nation's largest electricity and natural gas trader with an extensive network of gas pipelines. 


Dynegy is ranked sixth nationally in both electricity and natural gas marketing. 


The transaction would receive the greatest scrutiny at FERC, where the merger application would challenge the commission's merger-review policy, attorneys said. 

 
       Racing Against The Liquidity Clock 
   
""Enron is a complicated beast,"" and an acquisition by Dynegy likely would ""stretch FERC's limits of market-power review,"" one legal expert said. 

The primary question the commission will consider is whether combining the companies will increase market concentration in wholesale power markets to an unacceptable level. 


Also, FERC is in the process of changing the basis upon which it authorizes electricity sales at market-based rates, which could pose complications for a combined Enron-Dynegy down the road. 


According to Platts Power Markets Week, Enron's market share in competitive power markets is nearly 15%, while Dynegy's is pushing 5%. That makes the combined market share perilously close to the 20% threshold of concern under antitrust review. 


But FERC will undertake a more complicated analysis than that, looking at both vertical and horizontal market power, attorneys said. 


On a horizontal basis, there likely won't be much concern at FERC. Enron owns few hard generating assets compared to Dynegy, although FERC will scrutinize generation assets that Enron doesn't own but controls the output of on a contractual basis. 


It is in the vertical market power analysis where FERC's merger review gets truly complicated. 


The commission will assess to what degree the combination of Enron's pipelines - including one that controls 23% of natural gas imported from Canada - and Dynegy's portfolio of electric generation assets present competitive concerns. 


While Dynegy's pipeline holdings are far smaller than Enron's, it does have some upstream natural gas processing and gathering assets that FERC could view as problematic. 


Never before has FERC encountered a vertical market power analysis of such scale and scope before, legal experts agreed. 


Another aspect of the deal that will interest FERC, according to one attorney, is Enron's Internet-based trading platform, EnronOnline, through which 25% of wholesale power sales are traded. 


FERC has traditionally only looked at hard assets, but in recent weeks has indicated it intends to take a harder look at financial assets when considering market power issues. 


But even if FERC doesn't take on the issue, the Department of Justice or the Federal Trade Commission certainly will when considering the antitrust aspects of the combination. 


""These two companies are huge commodity traders. Oftentimes they're trading in commodities that have nothing to do with energy,"" noted one attorney. Antitrust agencies will scrutinize whether the combination could present market power concerns for nonenergy-related commodities as well as electricity and natural gas. 


As if the complicated market-power reviews by FERC and antitrust agencies weren't enough, the deal also must pass muster at the Securities and Exchange Commission under the 1935 Public Utility Holding Company Act. 


The Depression-era law restricts the geographic scope and nonenergy business holdings of multistate utility holding companies. 


Dynegy is an exempt holding company under the act, since its utility holding is confined to one state. It would have to register under the law and potentially divest assets to garner SEC approval as long as Enron still holds Portland General Electric, attorneys agreed. 


The SEC review also is complicated by the 26% stake in Dynegy held by ChevronTexaco (CVX). That investment was structured in a highly complex manner to avoid triggering regulation under the 1935 holding company act, according to a lawyer familiar with the deal. 


Dynegy could structure the deal in several different ways in order to sidestep holding company act restrictions, according to a leading legal expert on the law. 


Dynegy could take nonvoting or preferred stock with conversion rights contingent on Enron's selling the Oregon utility, the attorney said. ""There are ways to structure it short of a stock-for-stock deal, which is what most people think about."" 


Given the race against the clock driven by Enron's increasingly perilous liquidity crunch, such an investment sidestepping regulatory review may be the way the companies have to go in the near term. ""It's a run on the bank,"" the holding company act expert said. 


A Wall Street analyst suggested that, given Enron's predominance in energy markets, concerned Washington regulators and politicians may choose to expedite the deal. 


""Enron going down on the verge of winter is not a good thing,"" the analyst said. ""They may be more lenient if they can put a frigging tourniquet on Enron.""

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
?	Senate May Seal SoCal's Fate
?	SoCal Edison Eyeing Bankruptcy


California Senate & SoCal's Fate 
With the California Assembly's passage of SB 78XX last week, Senator John Burton (President Pro Tem) is positioned as perhaps the most legislatively powerful man in California.  Maintaining his hard line against the Assembly's amendments to SB78XX, Burton has completely rejected SB78 XX and has instead revived a previously introduced Assembly bill (AB 67XX), which had not faced a Senate floor vote.  The majority of AB 67XX's original language has been gutted by Burton and discretely replaced with the following points:

?	Financing of the dedicated rate component has been modified to incorporate a smaller rate base consisting of consumers using only 70 kv or more (formerly users as low as 20 kv were included).  The 70 kv value is rumored closer to 120 kv.
?	The state will have a 5-year option to purchase SoCal's transmission assets at twice book value and SoCal will be allowed to transfer profits from the sale to their parent company.
?	A renewables portfolio equal to 20% of total generation must be in place by 2010.  
?	There is an 11.6% return on generation in the bill.
?	The amount authorized for SoCal's bond issuance has been lowered from $2.9B to $2.5B.  
?	Direct access language has been included in the bailout bill.  The exact language, which was developed by Senator Bowen's office, is not yet known, however, earlier versions suggest that all parties will be forced to pay exit fees, switch providers no earlier than 2003, and there will be no cost shifting away from the DWR. (Note: Senator Burton is reportedly listening carefully to Treasurer Angelides' arguments about the revenue bonds not selling if direct access is included.)

It is doubtful that Burton will insist on the loyalty of fellow Democrats and will preferably discourage the bill's support.  The arrival of AB67 XX on the Senate floor may be little more than Burton's civil compliance with Gov. Davis' request.  All Republicans and at least 5 Democrats are expected to vote against the bill; an additional two dissenting Democrat votes would effectively block AB67 XX.  Consumer advocates that adamantly oppose this bill (because it lacks the state's ownership of hard transmission assets and burdens residential consumers with excessive rates) are ""optimistic"" about the bill's defeat in the Senate.  Despite these circumstances, it is highly conceivable that the Senate could pass along a virtually ineffective & inadequate bailout package for the Assembly's approval.

Burton is reportedly avoiding discourse with Davis over AB67 XX and as the hours pass ever closer to the midnight deadline, Burton will likely introduce the bill for floor vote and then hurriedly adjourn the Senate.  If the bill passes, the Assembly will bare the difficult task of either accepting the bill as is, or reject the bill and risk SoCal's bankruptcy.  We believe that if the bill makes it into the Assembly, AB67 XX will pass despite strong opposition from both the CTMA and consumer advocates.  There is no current vote count available in the Assembly, but we expect the Assembly to debate the bill into the early hours of Saturday morning. 

Inside Edison 
There are still strong indications that even if a bailout plan is passed, SoCal will voluntarily file for bankruptcy or a creditor, most likely a generator, will take them into bankruptcy.  SoCal remains concerned due to the number of contingent claims on their cash (by the DWR, etc.) and appear likely to try to protect these cash flows.  From the generators' perspective, if a plan is passed, the bank creditors will get paid but they will not.  Also, the DWR and ISO have not resolved even what amount is owed to generators for power they have provided this year, let alone when they will be paid.  The total amount owed through the ISO is approximately $2B.  Nonetheless, the generators remain under a federal order to provide power to the state.  Once a deal is passed leaving too little money for SoCal to pay the generators, this will leave them with little means of satisfaction other than filing against SoCal.

SoCal has privately indicated to Senators that if the AB 67XX fails to include any consumer using 100 kv or more as the base for the dedicated rate component, SoCal will be forced to file for bankruptcy because of their inability to effectively securitize the bailout bonds.  SoCal feels that this rate base is too small and the risk of these businesses fleeing the state is too high.  The CTMA also has indicated that some of its members may leave the state to avoid having to pay the extra surcharge on power.  

SoCal has not communicated a position on whether the $400 million trim (from the original $2.9B) puts them into bankruptcy. We estimate that an additional $400 million hit is indeed too much to bear and would prompt a voluntary bankruptcy petition. "

 <<What's new - Version 6 Information.pdf>> 
EPIS Announces North American Electricity Market Software and Database
for Forecasting Wholesale Electricity Prices 

AURORATM V6 Electric Market Model, proven leading-edge software package,
released with ready-to-use data for all the reliability regions in North
America to forecast wholesale electricity market prices.  AURORA
delivers the speed for forecasting market prices and modeling
uncertainty using multi-driver Monte Carlo simulations including random
resource outages with random frequency and duration.

PORTLAND, Oregon-December 4, 2001-EPIS, Inc., developer of pace-setting
software for the electric-power industry, today announced the release of
the North American Electricity Market Database and Version 6 of its
market modeling software, AURORA*. 
Already the fastest tool of its kind, AURORA delivers the critical
dispatch speed for risk analysis--modeling uncertainty using
multi-driver Monte Carlo simulations.  This swiftness, coupled with
market-simulated capacity-expansion logic, frees up time for the model
to consider more resource options in producing revenue forecasts for
asset valuations. 
AURORA and its North American electric market database simulate
electricity imports and exports to produce price forecasts for market
areas and trading hubs.  New Version 6 features include simulating
random resource outages and expressing inputs and outputs in
international units of choice.  AURORA models random forced outages for
resources and the random frequency and duration of resource outages.
This new outage approach allows units to fail or return to service at
any time during the simulation.  AURORA input and output may be in any
currency, or any unit for expression of fuel heat content, heat rate
heat content and emission quantity. The newly released database greatly
reduces the research and data collection time to produce accurate
electric market price forecasts for all the reliability regions in the
United States and Canada.
""Delivery of ready-to-use energy data for all the markets in North
America is unique to the AURORA electric market model.  We are putting
powerful forecasting capability into the hands of energy professionals,
dramatically increasing their understanding of forces behind electricity
prices,"" said Warren H. Winter, EPIS President.
Resource developers use AURORA to determine the value of existing- and
future-generation units.  They also use AURORA to understand the
underlying drivers of the forecasts--invaluable information for power
marketers and resource developers and planners.  Energy traders use
AURORA to forecast hourly, on-peak and off-peak electric prices for
trading hubs.  AURORA gives them immediate access to the resource
dispatch stacks and electricity price forecasts of day and forward
trading.  Also, gas traders use AURORA to forecast gas demand from
electric generation for gas trading. 
A Windows-based model, AURORA runs on Pentium class computers under
Windows XP/2000/NT 4.0/ME/and /98/.  Complete electricity pricing
results are available in a matter of seconds or minutes, rather than
hours or days, and do not require lengthy set-up or run times.
AURORA V6 is being delivered to current customers of EPIS, including
major North American electric-energy providers, utilities, consultants,
and agency and planning groups.
For more information about AURORA contact EPIS at (503) 722-2023 or
visit www.epis.com.
EPIS, Inc., based in Portland, Oregon, provides information on
electric-energy prices and market value by applying fundamental economic
principles to the emerging competitive energy market.  The company is
the developer of the AURORA electric market model, uses AURORA to
produce market forecasts, and supports clients who use AURORA to
forecast and analyze the energy marketplace.

During this critical time, it is imperative that our management team remain focused on our business and continue to address the challenges currently facing our company.  For that reason, I have decided to postpone the Enron Management Conference.

The Conference will now be held Friday, February 22 - Saturday, February 23, 2002 at the Westin La Cantera Resort in San Antonio.  While the Saturday meeting allows some Enron executives who cannot be away from the office during business hours to attend the Management Conference for the first time, I also recognize that it requires many of you to forfeit additional personal time on behalf of Enron.  I truly appreciate your sacrifice and I sincerely encourage your attendance.

The new agenda, while still being finalized, will be abbreviated but every bit as informative and worthwhile as previously planned.  We'll be in touch soon with more details.

Regards,
Ken Lay "

West Up, But Outlook Bearish

Most peak power prices in the West rose slightly for Tuesday delivery amid
unplanned unit outages and rising spot gas prices.  Nonetheless, most
traders said the strength would have been more prominent had it not been for
rain-boosted flows in the Northwest, and near-seasonal temperatures
throughout much of the WSCC.  With holiday loads fast approaching and
longer-term weather forecasts calling for a mild end for the month, it was
not surprising that most balance-of-December contracts were on the decline
Monday.  Despite a stronger cash market, NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures
contracts declined Monday on forecasts calling for near-seasonal
temperatures, as well as some technical selling.  January Hub gas shed 16
cents to close at 2.686$/mmBtu, while February fell 14.7 cents to end at
2.761$/mmBtu.  Early estimates for Wednesday's AGA inventory report called
for a 20 to 80-bcf draw last week, well below the 158-bcf draw seen a year
ago, and the five-year average draw of 102 bcf.  Total U.S. inventories
stand at 3.106 tcf, or 37 percent above last year.  ""We expect the storage
spread between this year and last to grow considerably in the next few
weeks, because last year we had huge draws due to sustained below-normal
temperatures, something that seems all too unlikely this year,"" said one gas
trader.  On a political note, Representative Joe Barton from Texas announced
the postponement of an electricity deregulation bill before Congress until
February.  The busy holiday season was cited as the reason, but most summed
it up to the nervousness from the Enron collapse.

Heavy load energy costs for Tuesday rose only marginally in the Northwest,
while light load goods were seen on the decline.  Seasonable temperatures
and recent heavy rains were prime culprits leading to the lackluster daily
market.  Peak power at the Mid-Columbia traded from 27.25 to 29.5$/MWh, with
the lowest prices reported out of the gate.  Light load goods saw action
anywhere between 17 and 24.25$/MWh, though most trades were done on the high
end of the spectrum, from 22 to 24$/MWh.  Flows remained healthy in the
rain-soaked region, with Chief Joseph forecast to see 90 kcfs Tuesday and
Wednesday, 95 kcfs Thursday and Friday, 65 kcfs Saturday, 45 kcfs Sunday,
and 90 kcfs on Christmas Eve.  When asked, most players believed that the
Christmas Eve flows were a mistake, and would be reduced in a future report.
In unit news, Colstrip #1 (330 MW) was brought down for scheduled
maintenance on Saturday, but was back in service 24 hours later.  Weather
forecasts for Seattle and Portland were calling for temperatures to dip
slightly through the week, but not into below-normal territory, while the
latest six-to-ten from the NWS was predicting above-normal temperatures for
the entire region from December 23 through 27.

With much activity on the generation front and stronger spot natural gas
prices, heavy load electricity prices across the Golden State edged up on
Monday.  ""Prices were generally floating down from the high end but bounced
around a bit as the day progressed.  In terms of the long-range forecasts,
it is not particularly strong,"" commented one trader.  At SP15, heavy load
electricity prices traded in a larger range on Monday, from 32 to
35.25$/MWh.  Off-peak prices were also seen on a wider scale, ranging from
24.5 to 28.4$/MWh.  Spot gas prices at the SoCal border were also stronger
on Monday, trading between 2.74 and 2.79$/mmBtu, up about 14 cents from
Friday.  In unit news, SP15-based El Segundo #4 (335 MW) went off-line
unexpectedly on Monday.  Gas-fired Moss Landing #6 (739 MW) was back at full
power on Monday following a planned maintenance outage that began on
November 3.  The weather forecast for Tuesday called for normal conditions
with highs in the upper 60s in the south and mid-50s in the north.
Overnight lows were expected to reach the mid-40s across the entire state.
The five-day forecast called for little change as the week progressed.  The
latest six-to-ten from the NWS called for above-normal temperatures from
December 23 to 27.

An unexpected unit outage and rising spot gas prices helped to prop up
prices in the Southwest on Monday, albeit slightly.  Mohave #1 (790 MW) was
taken off line Saturday for tube leak repairs, and was given an ETR of
""December 19 or 20.""  Being that we are talking about a Mohave unit, one
should err on the side of caution and go with the 20th.  Some parties said
the Mohave outage had little to do with the slightly higher prices, given
that it was more than offset by the weekend returns of two 750 MW units,
Four Corners #4 and Navajo #3.  Further to the north, Colorado-based Craig
#1 (428 MW) was brought down Saturday for unplanned repairs, with no ETR
given.  There were also unconfirmed reports that San Juan #3 (534 MW) was
operating near 50% on Monday.  Peak power at Palo Verde traded from 29 to
33.75$/MWh, with the bulk of deals done at the 33$/MWh mark.  Weather
forecasts called for seasonable temperatures through the week, while the
latest six-to-ten from the NWS was predicting a mix of normal and
below-normal temperatures from December 23 through 27.  ""Below-normal
temperatures in the Southwest this time of year could mean some higher
off-peak prices, but little more,"" said one industry soothsayer.

Amongst a healthier generation landscape and continued well above-normal
daytime highs, Monday's day-ahead electricity prices across the Eastern
Interconnect firmed up slightly on the low end, but softened for the most
part on the high.  ""We don't expect to see a whole lot of deviation in
prices until after the New Year,"" remarked one Eastern trader.  Spot natural
gas prices were stronger on Monday amid stronger weather related demand due
to a return to more normal like weather conditions later in the week.  In
the gas market, NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures tumbled substantially on
Monday.  The January contract fell 16 cents, while February also lost a
similar 14.7 cents.

Spot electricity prices across the Mid-Atlantic on Monday were mostly steady
to Friday, trading up forty cents on the high end.  Western PJM pieces
changed hands between 23.75 to 24.5$/MWh, with the bulk of deals going
through at 24$/MWh.  LMPs plateaued at almost 36$/MWh from 10:00 to 11:00
EST, before settling down to the day's average of 19.86$/MWh through 15:00.
In generation news, almost 2,000 MW returned to the grid over the weekend,
adding more supply to a still weak demand.  On the weather front,
temperatures for the Mid-Atlantic were expected to cool dramatically as the
week progressed.  Daytime highs for Tuesday were expected in the mid-50s,
about ten degrees above normal for this time of year.  By Friday, conditions
were expected to return to more seasonal levels for December.  The most
current six-to-ten from the NWS called for below-normal temperatures from
December 23 to 27.

With the return of a large unit to an already plentiful supply picture,
day-ahead power prices settled slightly lower on Monday in the Midwest.
Into Cinergy goods were bought and sold between 17.9 and 18.65$/MWh, with
the majority of transactions done from 18.2 to 18.4$/MWh.  Traders said
balance-of-the-week deals were being done right around 19$/MWh, with next
week trading 25 to 50 cents lower on lighter loads for the holiday.  On the
unit front, Michigan-based nuke Fermi #2 (1,085 MW) returned to service over
the weekend from its fall refueling outage, although whether it was
operating at full capacity or still ramping up on Monday afternoon could not
be confirmed.  ""Weather-wise, the worst is behind us this week,"" commented
one hopeful seller.  Tuesday forecasts called for highs in the
low-to-mid-40s and lows in the mid-30s, while the rest of the week was
expected to become progressively colder.  The latest six-to-ten predicted
below-normal temperatures from December 23 to 27.

Amid weak weather-related demand, but despite stronger spot gas prices,
heavy load electricity prices weakened across the Southeast and traded in a
narrower range on Monday.  Into Entergy prices gained fifty cents on the low
end, trading at 18$/MWh, while prices slipped seventy-five cents on the high
end to finish the day at the 20$/MWh mark.  Into TVA prices were seen in a
fifty cent range from 18.25 to 18.75$/MWh.  In generation news, South
Carolina Oconee #3 (847MW) returned to full capacity sometime over the
weekend.  Tuesday's highs for the Southeast were expected to range from the
mid-50s to the high-60s, still well above normal for the last remaining
weeks of the year.  The five-day forecast called for gradual cooling.  The
latest six-to-ten called for below-normal temperatures to blanket the region
from December 23 to 27.

Subject:	Update on Employee Expense Reimbursement


Post-Petition Expenses

Effective immediately, the processing of expense reimbursement for business expenses incurred by employees after Enron Corp.'s Chapter 11 filing (after December 2nd) has returned to normal.  Expenses will be reimbursed promptly upon submission.  Employees should conduct business travel in the ordinary course of business as approved by direct supervisors.  New travel and entertainment guidelines regarding business travel and other employee expenses will be forthcoming.  In the meantime, please use discretion as you incur expenses.  All expenditures should be made with consideration given to Enron's current financial situation.

Pre-Petition Expenses

We will immediately begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses for current and former employees (incurred prior to the December 2nd Chapter 11 filing) up to a maximum of $5,000.  We understand that a number of employees have pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000.  However, under the first day orders of the bankruptcy court, there is a $15,000 allowance per employee for unpaid pre-petition compensation, benefits, and related employee expenses.  This $15,000 cap was imposed without input from Enron management and counsel.  We have sought clarification from the bankruptcy court to assure that this $15,000 cap does NOT include the reimbursement of medical, dental, or vision related expenses.

We have commenced a manual review of every individual with pending pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000.  Even prior to clarification from the court regarding the medical/dental/vision expense issue, we will begin to reimburse pre-petition expenses in excess of $5,000 and up to $15,000 as soon as we can verify that the aggregate reimbursements to an individual employee have not exceeded the $15,000 cap.  Unfortunately, since this will be a manual process, it will take some time to work through.  Employees with pre-petition business expenses in excess of $5,000 can assist us with this manual review process by providing a brief email summary of their situation, including the total amount of pending pre-petition medical/dental/vision claims, to expensereport@enron.com.

Thank you for your patience.

Today, we announced plans to merge with Dynegy, a major player in the energy marketplace and one of our largest counterparties.  Dynegy is a great company with businesses very similar to our own.  We believe merging with Dynegy is the best option to preserve our core businesses that you've worked so hard to build.  Following are the major components of the transaction.

Deal Terms

--	The transaction will constitute a stock for stock exchange based on an exchange ratio of 0.2685 Dynegy shares for every Enron share.  For example, each 1,000 shares of Enron stock will be converted to 268 shares of Dynegy upon closing, plus cash for fractional shares, upon closing.
--	ChevronTexaco owns approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common stock.  ChevronTexaco will invest $1.5 billion in Dynegy immediately and an additional $1 billion in Dynegy on closing of the merger.  Dynegy will immediately invest $1.5 billion in cash in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary in exchange for preferred stock in Northern Natural Gas.
--   Total outstanding shares of the combined company are expected to be approximately 700 million shares.
--   The transaction is subject to shareholder and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close late next year.

Enron will have immediate access to Dynegy's $1.5 billion cash investment in Enron's Northern Natural Gas subsidiary.

Management of Newly Formed Company

Chuck Watson will be chairman and CEO of the newly formed company, which will be called Dynegy Inc., and Steve Bergstrom will be president and COO.

I will continue to serve as chairman and CEO of Enron until the transaction closes.  I will not join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Greg Whalley will continue to serve as president and COO of Enron until the transaction closes.  Then he will become an executive vice president of the new company and will join the Dynegy Office of the Chairman.  Mark Frevert will continue as vice chairman of Enron.

Management from Enron and Dynegy will work together to ensure a smooth, efficient integration.  The make-up of the integration team has not yet been determined.

The merger will be a long and complex process and is expected to close by the end of the third quarter 2002.  This merger will create an enormous growth engine, providing great opportunities for our employees, shareholders and customers.  As with any merger, some elimination of positions is almost inevitable, and one of our key tasks will be to identify the optimal structure of the new company.  We hope to be able to address any need for work force reductions through attrition and hiring reductions.  Clearly, we cannot rule out involuntary separation, but Dynegy is motivated to identify and retain the best talent from both organizations.  I promise you that I will do everything I can to make this transition as smooth as possible.

As I said in my video, this is a day like no other in our company's history.  We considered several options, but we believe that this merger with Dynegy is the best option to help rebuild investor and market confidence, strengthen our balance sheet and preserve our core businesses.

I know you have a lot of questions about this transaction and about next steps.  We have a list of frequently asked questions posted at <http://home.enron.com/updates/>.  If you have additional questions, please submit them to questions@enron.com <mailto:questions@enron.com>.  We will post updates as soon as we have answers to your questions.  If you receive any calls from the media, please refer them to our media team at (713) 853-5670.

I ask you to consider the enormously bright future of the newly formed company.  Rather than closing doors, we are opening new ones, as this deal enables the customers and shareholders of both companies to participate in the tremendous benefit of the combined enterprise, including our market reach, financial strength and industry experience.  Together, we will be a new merchant powerhouse.

And again, thank you for everything you have done for Enron.

And the Winner Is???

Day-ahead peak power prices in the Western U.S. rose slightly Tuesday on
revised weather forecasts calling for colder temperatures over the next few
days.  The most significant cooling was expected in the Northwest, where
heating demand was forecast to climb to above-normal levels by week's end.
""They've got plenty of hydro in the Northwest and that's what limited the
upside, but that also means there's less power available from the north, so
our prices went up a little as well,"" said one Southern California utility
trader.  Many players anticipated more strength on Wednesday as the colder
weather draws closer, but most expected the upside to be limited due to the
abundant hydropower and relatively soft spot gas prices.  In other industry
news, Weil Gotshal & Manges, the lead law firm for bankrupt Enron, reported
Tuesday that multiple bids had been filed for a controlling stake in Enron
Corp.'s energy trading business.  Weil plans to announce the winning bidder
at its New York offices Thursday, and then present the offer to the U.S.
bankruptcy court in New York for approval on Friday.  Meanwhile, the court
is hearing arguments from creditors on why the case should be transferred to
Texas.  While the bids and the bidders were to remain confidential, it was
reported that Citicorp Inc. and UBS Warburg were among the suitors, though a
third financial institution that had previously expressed interest, J.P.
Morgan Chase & Co., declined to submit a bid by Monday's night's deadline.
British company BP Plc. also said it may be interested in the operations,
and had submitted a bid of $25 million for a small portion of Enron's
assets, including some back office functions and some IT assets.  Enron's
lawyers have stated that the company is not looking for cash bids, but
rather an ownership stake of up to 51 percent.

Heavy load energy costs in the Northwest rose by an average of 1$/MWh for
Wednesday delivery.  Cooler weather forecasts were near-universally blamed
for the rising dailies, though most players conceded that healthy river
flows would limit the upside.  ""The colder weather is a small blessing for
sellers, but also for the region as a whole.  The recent warm weather has
caused some snowmelt, something few people want to see until the spring, and
the lower temperatures should put a stop to that,"" said one Northwest
trader.  According to Weather Derivatives, heating demand in the region was
expected to average 64 percent of normal Wednesday, and then rise to a peak
of 120 percent of normal by Sunday.  Flow forecasts for Chief Joseph were
little changed from a day ago, coming in at 85 kcfs through Friday, 70 kcfs
Saturday, 55 kcfs Sunday, and back up to 85 kcfs next Monday and Tuesday.

Despite lackluster trading and continued mild weather, day-ahead electricity
prices enjoyed a tempered upturn in California on Tuesday.  Gains were
modest, on the order of a dollar everywhere.  Traders cited colder
temperatures on the horizon and an incremental upswing in Western spot gas
prices as the main factors leading prices higher.  ""Balance of the month is
trading at a premium to the dailies, which is usually a sign of coming
strength,"" said one trader.  Peak goods at NP15 were bought and sold between
22.25 and 23.75$/MWh, while the off-peak products changed hands from 16.5 to
18$/MWh.  In political news, the FERC judge for the California refund case
said he will hold evidentiary hearings through July 12, and submit his
proposal to FERC by early August.  The state accuses energy companies of
overcharging during last year's energy crisis, an allegation the companies
deny.  On a less litigious note, last month FERC asked the CAISO to come up
with a detailed plan for reforming the state's energy market.  The proposal
could be unveiled as early as late Tuesday, and would include elements of
the much-admired PJM RTO.  It would also emphasize a way to reduce
intra-zonal congestion and include a plan for a day-ahead market, although
on a smaller scale then the former one run by the CalPX.  There were no
dramatic changes in the generation landscape on Tuesday.  Moss Landing #6
(739 MW) and Etiwanda #4 (320 MW) returned to the grid, while hydro unit Big
Creek Project (1,020 MW) was operating at 970 MW.  On the weather front,
Wednesday forecasts predicted high temperatures in the mid-50s and low-60s
at mid-state load centers, and in the high-60s in the south.  Little change
was expected in temperatures through Saturday.  The most current six-to-ten
called for below-normal temperatures from January 14 to 18.

Heavy load energy costs in the Southwest rose by an average of less than a
dollar on Tuesday, with the modicum of strength chalked up to rising spot
gas prices and cooler temperatures on the horizon.  Peak power at Palo Verde
ranged from 20 to 22$/MWh, with the bulk of transactions seen right in the
middle at 21$/MWh.  Balance-of-January contracts were heard trading at about
a $2/MWh premium to the dailies on Tuesday, likely in reaction to the cooler
forecasts.  In unit news, Coronado #1 (365 MW) was in the process of
restarting Tuesday afternoon, as expected.  Four Corners #5 (750 MW) was
operating at 550 MW Tuesday due to air-preheater problems, with no available
ETR to full.  Weather Derivatives forecast heating demand in the desert
region to climb from its current level of 50 percent of normal, to just
above normal over the coming weekend, but the latest six-to-ten was still
calling for a mix of normal and above-normal temperatures from January 14
through 18.

___________________________________________________________
Amid forecasts for warmer weather on Wednesday and little else changed in
market fundamentals, heavy load energy costs drifted lower across the
Eastern Interconnect on Tuesday.  ""The EIA revised the Q1 electricity demand
estimate downwards today.  That shouldn't really affect the dailies, but
sometimes its what people think will happen that matters more than what
actually does happen,"" suggested one market analyst, who added that he
thought weather was a greater factor in the dip in day-ahead prices.  NYMEX
Henry Hub natural gas futures settled higher on Tuesday.  February gained
0.9 cents to close at 2.281$/mmBtu, while the March contract picked up 2.4
cents to end at 2.285$/mmBtu.

Day-ahead electricity prices softened in the Mid-Atlantic on Tuesday amid
warm weather forecasts for the rest of this week and next, and on light
demand in the region.  Western PJM goods changed hands in a narrow range
between 24.2 and 24.85$/MWh.  According to traders, prices were low out of
the gate, climbed to the peak within an hour, and ended the day back down at
the low end.  No new outage information was available on Tuesday.  High
temperatures were expected in the 45 to 51 degree range in PJM on Wednesday,
and forecast to stay within five degrees of there through Saturday.  The
latest six-to-ten called for normal temperatures from January 14 to 18.

Temperatures in the Midwest were expected to climb to their highest level of
the week on Wednesday, bringing peak power prices down by about a dollar on
Tuesday.  Into Cinergy pieces for Wednesday delivery traded between 19.55
and 21.25$/MWh, dropping 0.75 and 0.95$/MWh off the high and low ends,
respectively.  The February contract gained some support Tuesday morning,
opening strong and climbing to 23.15$/MWh before dropping back down to
22.25$/MWh.  ""Prior to the open, gas looked strong, and people were buying
February to cover their shorts, but gas came off fast and that was the end
of that,"" said one trader of the ill-fated early rally and fizzle.
Temperatures at most ECAR load centers were expected to hit the upper-40s on
Wednesday, with corresponding lows in the mid-30s.  Thursday forecasts
called for temperatures to stay near that level, while Friday was expected
to cool five to seven degrees.  The most current six-to-ten from the NWS
predicted normal temperatures from January 14 to 18.

As natural gas weakness continued to concern Southeastern traders, and
forecasts called for significantly warmer temperatures for the rest of the
week, heavy load electricity prices softened in the Southeast on Tuesday.
Into Entergy deals were done from 19 to 20$/MWh, while Into TVA deals for
Wednesday delivery were heard between 20.25 and 21.5$/MWh.  TVA prices
reached their low late in the day.  In unit news, sources said one of the
Scherer coal units (832, 833, 844, and 844 MW) was off-line but expected
back on Thursday.  The latest six-to-ten called for above-normal
temperatures from January 14 to 18.

Savings Plan.  The amendment includes the following changes, which became effective on November 29:

?	Savings Plan contributions that are deducted from your November 30 paycheck will be matched by Enron in cash rather than Enron stock.  The cash match will be placed into the Fidelity Freedom 2000 fund, the default fund for the Plan.  

?	After November 30, Enron will no longer match your savings plan contributions.  As an exception, the company will continue the union matching contributions to the Plan.

?	The Savings Plan has always permitted employees to place their contributions in Enron stock or one or more alternative investment options.  Effective immediately, diversification within the Plan will ALSO be allowed, regardless of your age, from COMPANY contribution accounts.  This removes the restriction for all employees under the age of 50 to diversify the company contributions held in their account.  These accounts include all prior company contributions, QNEC, and company match accounts.  

To move funds:
On the Web, choose ""Savings Plan--Restricted Employer Acct Transfer/Reallocation"" from the drop down menu.
On Voice Response, choose ""request for fund transfer/reallocation of your restricted employer accounts.""
This will allow you to move money from the four formerly restricted accounts: Company Matching, Union Matching, Prior Matching, and QNEC.

To avoid phone delays, we recommend that you access your account through the web at http://resources.hewitt.com/enron or through benefits.enron.com."

Bear Sighting in the West

Despite the uncertainty that goes hand in hand with scheduling three days
out, Western peak power prices for Monday delivery were mostly lower on
Friday amid a plethora of bearish fundamentals.  Waning weather-related
demand, lower spot gas prices and ample hydroelectric generation were some
of the forces placing downward pressure on the daily electricity market.  ""I
can't believe how low prices are right now, so low in fact that they are
below the cost of our gas-fired generation,"" said one frustrated would-be
seller.  The weather outlook offered little hope for strength in the near
term, with heating demand in the WSCC expected to average a mere 68 percent
of normal through January 11.  Light load goods did manage to gain a little
strength at some of the Western hubs, mainly on the inclusion of the all-day
Sunday piece.  NYMEX Henry Hub contracts for February and March were almost
unchanged from the previous day, both gaining less than one cent on Friday.
""Given the current weather outlook, we could see some more downside for
Henry Hub contracts on Monday,"" warned one gas watcher.

Monday's heavy load energy costs in the Northwest were mostly flat to lower
on Friday as mild weather forecasts and abundant hydropower continued to
depress the market.  Peak power at the Mid-Columbia traded from 17.75 to
20$/MWh, with the bulk of transactions occurring around the 18.75$/MWh mark.
Balance-of-January contracts trading in the 20.25 to 20.75$/MW range was a
good indicator that most players were not expecting any significant rise in
prices through the month.  Light load goods fell by as much as 1.25$/MWh,
with confirmed trades taking place anywhere between 15.75 and 17.5$/MWh.
""There's just nothing out there that could bring the dailies up, the weather
is just too mild and hydro too plentiful,"" said one Washington-based trader.
Flow forecasts for Chief Joseph were little changed Friday, coming in at 75
kcfs Saturday, 60 kcfs Sunday, 110 kcfs Monday, 105 kcfs Tuesday through
Thursday, and 100 kcfs on Friday.

Power prices for the Sunday/Monday package in the Golden State followed the
rest of the Western electricity market down on Friday.  ""The California snow
pack is around 160%, gas storage is high, prompt-month gas is down, forwards
are off, precipitation is plentiful, and to top it all off the weather is
mild.  Basically every fundamental I can think of is bearish,"" said one
northern trader of the dailies' plunge.  ""With gas storage so high, it will
take a longer cold snap than usual to generate an upside in this market,""
said another, adding that the extended forecast didn't call for a possible
change in the weather until January 17.  Electricity at NP15 and SP15 traded
almost flat to one another.  NP15 peak goods changed hands between 22.5 and
25$/MWh, while the off-peak product saw action from 17.25 to 19$/MWh.  On
the generation front, Los Medanos (550 MW) was operating at 530 MW on
Friday.  Fellow gas-fired generators Morro Bay #3 (337 MW) and Alamitos #4
(320 MW) were out of service for planned maintenance.  High temperatures for
the early part of the new week were expected in the mid-50s at mid-state
load centers, and in the upper-60s in southern regions.  Overnight lows were
anticipated to be about 13 to 16 degrees below the highs.  The latest
six-to-ten called for above-normal temperatures from January 10 to 14.

Not even news of new unit outages was enough to perk up spot prices in the
Southwest on Friday, though the all-day Sunday/off-peak Monday package did
see a smidgeon of strength.  Peak power at Palo Verde ranged from 21 to
25$/MWh, with most trades taking place from 22.5 to 23$/MWh.  In unit news,
it was confirmed that San Juan #1 (350 MW) was brought down on Tuesday for
tube leak repairs.  Sources said that the unit was due back ""any minute
 now,"" but it had yet to be revived as of this writing.  Four Corners #4 and
#5 (750 MW each) tripped Friday due to ""instrument error,"" and were given an
ETR of sometime on Sunday.  Mohave #2 (790 MW) was expected to attempt a
return Friday night, but players with a share of the unit indicated that it
had not been scheduled in place for Sunday or Monday.  ""Those units [Mohave]
are so unreliable on startup, that they've got to be up and running for 24
hours before you can say that they're really back,"" joked one marketer.
Looking ahead, Palo Verde #2 (1,270 MW) was scheduled to enter a 30-day
spring maintenance outage on March 16.  Weather forecasts for the Phoenix
area called for warming through Tuesday, while the latest six-to-ten from
the NWS called for mostly above-normal temperatures in Arizona and normal
conditions in New Mexico from January 10 through 14.

___________________________________________________________
Amid forecasts calling for milder temperatures in the new week and a
volatile gas market, heavy load electricity prices for Monday delivery
traded much lower across the Eastern Interconnect on Friday.  The Southeast
lost the most ground, with prices falling throughout the day.  NYMEX Henry
Hub natural gas futures were flat to Thursday's bearish levels, with the
front-month closing up less than a cent at 2.275$/mmBtu.  March picked up
just 0.2 cent to end at 2.265$/mmBtu.


Amid significantly fewer electricity imports, a stronger real-time price for
most of the morning, and rumors of a base-load nuclear unit still off-line,
peak power prices only shed a relatively benign 2$/MWh.  Western PJM goods
changed hands between 26.25 and 26.75$/MWh, with the high end bid up very
late in the day.  The bulk of deals were done between 26.35 and 26.4$/MWh.
Some traders thought Salem #2 (1,106 MW) was still down, or tripped in the
early morning after coming back briefly Thursday, but no one was entirely
certain which units were off Friday.  LMPs bounced between 25 and 31$/MWh
for most of the morning, and averaged 24.79$/MWh through 15:00 EST.  Monday
forecasts called for low temperatures in the 34 to 35 degree range, firmly
above freezing, while highs were expected to stay in the 37 to 41 degree
range.  The latest six-to-ten predicted mostly above-normal temperatures
from January 10 to 14.

With weather conditions expected to warm up in the new week, peak power
prices slipped in the Midwest on Friday in active trade.  Into Cinergy
pieces were bought and sold between 19 and 26$/MWh.  In unit news, Illinois
nuke LaSalle (1,144 MW) powered down to 90% capacity on Friday, on its way
to a mid-month refueling outage.  High temperatures were expected just above
freezing on Monday, with overnight lows in the mid-20s.  The most current
six-to-ten from the NWS called for mostly above-normal temperatures from
January 10 to 14.

Rising gas concerns spelled falling electricity prices in the Southeast on
Friday.  ""The market was pushed down all day, but fell very fast at the end
when lots of people were trying to sell based on rumors that gas prices were
going to come off even more.  They really got burned by their positions,""
commented one trader on the tanking Southeastern spot market.  Into Entergy
prices were seen from 22.5$/MWh out-of-the-gate down to 17$/MWh.
Balance-of-the-month also weakened on Friday, trading between 20 and
21$/MWh, falling over a dollar to a day ago, mainly on the mild weather
outlook.  Into TVA deals were heard between 21.5 and 25.5$/MWh, trailing
down more than 5$/MWh on both ends.  According to sources, maintenance at
one of TVA's coal-fired Paradise units (704, 704, and 1,150 MW) was
reportedly at least a week behind schedule.  Weather conditions were
expected to warm up in the early part of the new week, giving thin-blooded
Southerners some relief from the snow and cold that saddled the region this
week.  The latest six-to-ten called for mostly below-normal temperatures
from January 10 to 14.

Elizabeth,

Here is a quick draft at a script to get some broker quotes.  Unfortunately, we will not be able to get firm quotes because our counterparties will not give them to us.  As a consequence, we will only be able to get indicative quotes from brokers.  I am assuming that you are preoccupied with other pressing matters; If I don't hear from you by tomorrow on this, I will distribute this to the term traders, and then we can improve the script later.---sch


Hi,

I'm calling you back to go over the spreadsheet you sent me.  I need to make a record of this.  Could you please spell your name for me and give me your phone number?  And you work at ________?  Great.

I sent you a spreadsheet showing different delivery points and durations for the delivery of power.  Is that right?  

And I asked you to provide indicative market prices for these products?  Is that right?

Were you able to provide some indicative prices?

How did you get those prices?  

Do you believe that these prices accurately and substantially represent market prices at which counterparties would buy and sell power today, November ____, 2001?

Great.  Thank you.

Calif Attorney Genl Says Likely To File More Energy Suits
Dow Jones Newswires

SAN FRANCISCO (AP)--California Attorney General Bill Lockyer said Wednesday
he is likely to file more unfair business practice lawsuits against energy
suppliers he thinks overcharged for electricity.

But Lockyer, in a telephone interview, said after a yearlong investigation
he has found no criminal wrongdoing by any energy suppliers. He said he has
discovered possible civil violations of California consumer laws prohibiting
overcharging - violations that carry no jail or prison time.

Lockyer's disclosure came a week after the state's top law enforcement
official sued Pacific Gas and Electric Corp., the parent to Pacific Gas and
Electric Co., for allegedly siphoning billions from its underling and
forcing it to seek federal bankruptcy protection.

The PG&E suit is ""the first of many I would expect in the energy area to
overcome overcharges,"" Lockyer told The Associated Press.

""We've devoted a huge amount of investigative and lawyering time to get back
the money...generators extracted from Californians,"" he added.

Lockyer declined to name other companies that he would sue, but his office
has subpoenaed records from Dynegy, Enron Corp., Mirant Corp. and Reliant
Energy - all of which have denied wrongdoing. In the interview, the attorney
general did mention Enron by name, saying ""we're still looking at the energy
overcharges,"" and he accused Enron of withholding documents.

Enron, a major energy trading concern, has filed for bankruptcy protection
following the disclosure that it misstated its earnings by hundreds of
millions of dollars.

PG&E, the only supplier Lockyer has sued, blamed its woes on a 1996
California law that left it unable to collect the full price of electricity
from its customers.

Lockyer's disclosure that he hasn't discovered criminal conduct, including
no evidence of a conspiracy to fix prices, comes nearly a year after he said
he wanted to jail Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman. Lockyer told the Wall
Street Journal in May that, ""I would love to personally escort Lay to an 8
by 10 cell that he could share with a tattooed dude who says, 'Hi my name is
Spike, honey.""'

On Wednesday, Lockyer declared the statement ""rhetorical excess,"" adding,
""So far...we haven't found criminal behavior associated with pricing
policies.""

Still, the city of San Francisco has accused 13 energy suppliers of
manipulating prices in a suit that is pending in San Diego County Superior
Court.

That suit alleges the suppliers manipulated supplies to keep prices high.
San Francisco Deputy City Attorney Mark Slavin said the city doesn't have
proof of those allegations, but would uncover them as the lawsuit proceeds
in a process known as discovery.

""We think that the discovery process will uncover anticompetitive behavior,""
Slavin said.

The energy suppliers have denied the allegations.

A California legislative committee also investigating a spike in wholesale
energy costs has served additional subpoenas on Enron officials.

The Senate Select Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation in the
Wholesale Energy Market summoned Enron officials to appear for depositions
regarding destruction of documents. Sen. Joe Dunn, D-Santa Ana, and the
committee's chairman, said he's concerned that documents destroyed by
Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, were covered by a legislative subpoena
issued in June.

Dunn's committee on Wednesday also agreed to subpoena Andersen regarding the
Enron records.

Our settlement allows Dynegy to exercise its option to acquire the pipeline, dismisses their Texas lawsuit and extends Enron's right to repurchase until June 30.  We reached this settlement as part of our efforts to bring Enron out of bankruptcy.  While we would like to keep Northern Natural, we still have some 9,000 miles of safe, profitable interstate pipelines as a base to rebuild our core businesses.  

The settlement provides the best opportunity to resolve the pipeline issue quickly and pursue our $10 billion damage claim against Dynegy.  It also allows us to avoid the very substantial costs and distractions from protracted litigation in state courts.  

We want to see a positive future for the employees working with Northern Natural Gas.  Below is a copy of a message from Stan Horton further explaining this decision to the employees of Enron Transportation Services.

Ken



Dear ETS Colleague:

On Thursday, Enron entered into a settlement over Dynegy's exercise of its option to acquire the Northern Natural Gas pipeline.  The settlement allows Dynegy to exercise the option and assume interim control of the pipeline while Enron pursues its damage claim against Dynegy.  

In this respect, Enron Corp. has carefully weighed the substantial costs and turmoil that litigating this possession issue would create for the company and the employees of Northern Natural Gas.  Consequently, Enron Corp. has decided not to contest interim possession and allow the transfer of Northern Natural Gas to Dynegy, while the larger issues affecting its future are resolved.

The company has concluded that with this settlement, Enron should be able to resolve the issue more quickly, as well as avoid the legal cost burden and distractions to the business from protracted litigation in state court.  For the Northern Natural Gas employees, I believe this decision should allow them to steer clear of the dispute and focus on the day-to-day satisfaction of running a valuable, successful business.

Beginning immediately we will be working to achieve a smooth transition and to align the appropriate resources to assure continued safe, reliable and efficient operation of Northern Natural Gas.  

Over many years we have run high quality, cost conscious and profitable businesses in ETS.  Keep up the good work!

Stan"

FERC Calls for Change

Western peak power prices slid substantially on Wednesday, primarily on
reduced holiday-weekend loads.  Players traded a Thursday-through-Saturday
package on Wednesday to accommodate the Christmas holiday on Tuesday,
December 25.  Players will schedule for Sunday and Monday on Thursday, and
for Tuesday and Wednesday on Friday.  No prescheduling will take place in
the WSCC on Christmas Eve or Christmas Day.  Other factors helping to push
the dailies lower were abundant Northwest hydropower and slightly lower spot
gas prices.  ""Between now and the new year many traders will be out of the
office and loads will remain at holiday levels, so we don't expect much
movement or activity until 2002, barring any sustained cold or unit outages,
of course,"" said one marketer.  While no one can predict the stability of
generating units, forecasters predicted mostly normal and above-normal
temperatures for the entire West through the end of the month.  NYMEX Henry
Hub futures contracts for the front months rose early on end-of-December
forecasts calling for below-normal temperatures in the Midwest and Eastern
U.S., but fell late after another bearish AGA report to finish the day in
negative territory.  January Hub gas shed 4.1 cents to settle at
2.616$/mmBtu, while February fell 6.2 cents to close at 2.65$/mmBtu.
Wednesday's AGA inventory report, delayed more than 20 minutes due to a
computer problem, indicated that U.S. gas stock fell 45 bcf last week, below
most industry estimates, the 158-bcf draw seen a year ago, and the five-year
average decline of 102 bcf.  Total U.S. inventories stood at 3.061 tcf, 948
bcf or 45 percent above last year.  Of the 45 bcf taken out last week, six
were drawn from the Consuming Region West.  Total inventories in the West
were reported at 438 bcf, or 87 percent of full.  According to the National
Resources Conservation Service, precipitation throughout much of the West
was at above-normal levels as of Wednesday.  California, Idaho, Montana,
Nevada, Oregon, Utah and Washington were all sporting Accumulative
Precipitation Averages well above 100 percent of normal.  However, opinions
varied as to whether or not this trend would continue through the winter
months.  In other industry news, FERC on Wednesday raised its wholesale
electricity price cap for the Western states to 108$/MWh, up from the
previous cap of 92$/MWh.  The increase, in effect through April 30, 2002,
was implemented as a precaution in case of strong demand in the Pacific
Northwest this winter.  The cap is tied to the region's natural gas market,
which means it could be recalculated if natural gas prices change
dramatically, FERC said.  Western traders voiced little enthusiasm about the
new order.

With an overabundance of hydro generation and the inclusion of Saturday in
the three-day package, both on peak and off-peak prices across the Golden
State dipped considerably on Wednesday.  ""With a rainstorm looming off the
California coast, prices had nowhere to go but down,"" commented a Western
player.  Peak power at NP15 was heard trading between 25.5 and 29$/MWh,
shedding a whopping 4 and 5$/MWh at the high and low ends, respectively.
According to a CAISO spokesperson, FERC was expected to issue an order on
Wednesday that would, among other things, ask the CAISO to submit by May 1,
2002 a proposal for redesigning the California market, including the
creation of a day-ahead market.  The CAISO day-ahead market would likely be
an extension of their current real-time market, as opposed to a daily
auction such as the one held by the former CalPX.  In other news, FERC
reopened the inquiry into whether or not El Paso Corp., which owns and
operates four pipelines into California, manipulated the California market
during the supply shortages last winter.  Lastly, SCE told the CPUC that
Enron's service to its California customers was deteriorating, and the
utility urged the commission to decide on an alternate supplier if Enron
fails to meet its obligations.  On the generation front, there was an
additional 2,132 MW off-line in the CAISO control area Wednesday, in
comparison to a day ago.  Gas-fired Moss Landing #6 (739MW) was off-line
Wednesday with no available ETR, while Los Medanos (550 MW) was operating at
230MW, or 42% of capacity.  Although an official ETR was unavailable, rumors
circulated that Sutter Plants (546 MW) would not be back until December 22
at the earliest.  SONGS #3 (1,080 MW) was back at full power Wednesday
following a 100 MW reduction for two days due to a mechanical pump problem.
Forecasts called for near-normal temperatures to continue for the rest of
the week in the Golden State, while the latest six-to-ten from the NWS
predicted above-normal temperatures from December 25 to 29.

___________________________________________________________
With stronger natural gas prices and colder weather finally setting in,
heavy load energy costs gained ground across the Eastern Interconnect on
Wednesday.  ""It's cooler and cloudy here so demand picked up, but trade is
thinner since many players are already on vacation,"" said one Midwestern
player. The AGA weekly report listed a bearish 45-bcf withdrawal for the
previous week, well below expectations.  NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures
slipped in very late trade, with the front-month contract losing 4.1 cents
to close at 2.616$/mmBtu.  February edged down 6.2 cents to end at
2.65$/mmBtu.

Peak power prices rose in the Mid-Atlantic on Wednesday, despite a very
healthy generation landscape.  Prices at Western PJM traded in a quarter
spread, up about a buck on both the low and high ends.  Deals were heard in
the 24.9 to 25.15$/MWh range.  The winter contract was trading in a range
from 30.85 to 31.2$/MWh.  Real-time prices were up for the usual morning
peak periods of the day, but after 11:00 EST, they were on a steady decline,
and averaged 17.3$/MWh through 15:00 EST.  In weather news, temperatures
were forecast for the mid-40s on Thursday across the East, a few degrees
above normal for late in December.  Much of the same was predicted for the
next five days, with a slim rise in temperatures by the weekend.  The latest
six-to-ten from the NWS called for below-normal temperatures from December
25 to 29.

Forecasts for Thursday called for slightly cooler temperatures, lending
strength to heavy load electricity prices in the Midwest on Wednesday.  Into
Cinergy pieces changed hands between 20 and 22.4$/MWh, gaining a respectable
1.5$/MWh at both ends.  In political news, FERC approved the MidwestISO as
the East's first RTO, and ordered the competing for-profit entity Alliance
to join it.  FERC has heavily pushed for the formation of RTOs since the
California energy crisis of earlier this year.  FERC hopes the new
organization will boost competition in the region and provide a good example
for the rest of the country.  High temperatures were expected in the 36 to
40 degree range across ECAR on Thursday.  Temperatures were predicted to
linger about five degrees above normal through Sunday.  The latest
six-to-ten from the NWS called for below-normal temperatures from December
25 to 29.

With highs predominantly in the mid-50s through Sunday and little news
otherwise, day-ahead power prices firmed in the Southeast on Wednesday.
Into Entergy goods were bought and sold between 20.5 and 22$/MWh, while Into
TVA deals were heard between 20.25 and 21.5$/MWh, rising about 2 dollars at
both ends.  However, TVA traders said most transactions were completed near
the low end of the range.  Overnight lows for Thursday were expected to be
at or just above freezing across SERC.  The most current six-to-ten called
for below-normal temperatures from December 25 to 29.

I know its been two months since the last update.  So this is long overdue.
But then again I haven't heard one peep out of 75% of you on this email
list, so sorry to say, this will be your last Update.  All of the dead beats
are getting dropped.  YOU KNOW WHO I AM TALKING ABOUT!  Oh, and don't bother
emailing me with a bunch of excuses, you're getting dropped and that's that.
(Maybe I kidding....maybe I'm not....)

Well let's get everyone caught up........

This is going to be a long one, so get comfortable....the last two months
has involved a lot of travelling.  I've been to Switzerland, sailing in the
North Sea, London (twice, as per usual), Monaco, New York (twice, for two
weddings, also no surprise), and Spain.  I'll recap a few of my journeys for
everyone.....

I'd like to start with my trip to London.  I went to my first real Cricket
match, England vs. Pakistan.  Unfortunately I went with clients that knew
much more than I did about the sport.  The traders of Axia Energy easily
took me for ?300.  A word of advice for my American friends, do not bet on
English sports that you don't know anything about.  You would have figured
that I had known that.  Sometimes my stupidity even surprises me.....Okay
Axia, you got me this time, we'll see what happens this weekend at the
American Football match in Amsterdam...!

The following weekend I was off to the French Riviera and the Monaco Grand
Prix.....intense sporting event.  Mind numbingly loud, beautiful weather,
and a great night in the casino.  Although, it's official, my French sucks.
Six years of French in school and I barely know how to ask for a glass of
water.  I'm not happy about that.  Oh! Speaking of languages, I have
enrolled in formal Dutch lessons with a few guys from the desk.  Classes
begin in September, twice a week, two hours a night for two months.  I can't
wait for the Update after the final.  Yes, there is a final.  Any way, let's
continue.....

My next weekend brought back home to New York City and Bob and Stephanie's
wedding.  Congratulations you two, I think you should be back from your
honeymoon by now?  Anyway beautiful event, very happy I was asked to be a
part of it.  Great to see a lot of old friends.  And....as promised, I did
not have to find a hidden place to take a nap.  Dave and Felice, I still
feel bad about that.  While on the wedding thing.....last weekend I returned
home for 38 hours to attend Deirdra and Penn's wedding.  Surprisingly enough
I stayed awake for this one too!  In all fairness, it was easy, it was a day
wedding.  Which was very helpful.  Anyway those two are in the Caribbean
having a blast I'm sure.  Not me, it's 7:15pm and I'm in my office writing
this stupid e-mail.   I think I'm going to set up a cot behind my desk...?

I have to mention a little trip I took in between weddings.....a bunch of
the Prebon's European managers had an off-site meeting in the South of Spain
(Malaga to be exact).  It was suppose to be in Barcelona, but that's a whole
different story.  I think I'll leave that part of the story out.
Anyway.....I have learned a few things about travelling lately, especially
about air travel.  We all know I fly a lot, I mean a lot.  I have a new
rule, avoid crappy airlines like the plague.  It's just not worth it.
Airlines to avoid while in Europe....Basic Air (with that name alone, I
should have known better), Luxair, actually I can take that one step
further, avoid Luxembourg airport and any flight that flies there.  I'll
elaborate....why wouldn't I?....First of all I take KLM to Luxembourg, no
problems there and I have to transfer to a Luxair flight that will be taking
me to Malaga.  Well after waiting on line with a bunch of old rude people we
pile into a bus.  We wait in the hot sweaty bus for 15 minutes, finally the
bus leaves.  I kid you not, we the bus ride was 30 feet long.  I was in
shock.  Don't worry it gets worse.....I squeeze into my seat, I think there
was nine inches (22.5 centimeters) of leg room.  Every single seat is
occupied.  Miraculously I fall asleep....but not for long.  The flight
attendant wakes me up from a dead sleep in order to serve me my ""meal"", I'm
using that term loosely.  So now I'm awake (which I'm not happy about) and I
have the scariest pate in front of me I've ever seen.  It looked so bad I
had to try it.  For the first time in my life I almost had to employ the air
sickness bag.  It was horrible.  I do have to mention, there was one good
thing....after the ""meal"", they did serve complimentary cognac, which was
nice.  Quick frankly, I felt they owed to me, but I was thankful none the
less.   There is something else that bothered me, but it nothing to do with
Luxair....

Now that I have almost been poisoned, I knew that there was no chance for me
to fall back asleep.  So I start reading the book I brought with me, ""The
Bonfire of the Vanities"" by Tom Wolfe.  Well in the end I found the book
entertaining, but I have one major problem with it.  I'm reading about this
guy Lawrence Kramer who is on his way to the court house in the Bronx (he's
an Assistant District Attorney) and Tom Wolfe has this guy getting on the D
train at 81st street and Central Park West.  Duh!  Everybody knows that on
the upper west side the D train and the A train are both express from 59th
Street to 125th Street.  The only west side local train that stops at 81st
Street and the Bronx Courthouse (161st Street) is the B train and sometimes
the C train.  I know I'm being a little petty, but give me a break, the
author ""claims"" to reside in New York City (I read the back cover), get your
facts straight pal.

Tomorrow I'm off the European World Bowl (American Football) with 25
clients.  I have a feeling my high school team could beat either team, but
it should be fun none the less....we'll see.

I would like to welcome the following people into the world....Vanessa
Malhame, Joel Kabel and Melissa Moore (my new niece) who was just born on
Wednesday night!

That's it, until next time......Enjoy your summer,

-Douglas Pursel Moore

Misery Loves Company

Heavy load energy costs in the Western U.S. rose for Monday delivery on
expectations of more weather-related demand at the start of the new week, as
well as on the usual premium that occurs when scheduling three days out.
Several players expected more strength later in the week when temperatures
were forecast to dip even further.  Some parties also claimed that a rise in
the number of unit outages could play a role in strengthening the daily
electricity market.  ""It was a pretty boring day in the spot electricity
market, there was no volatility and no liquidity.  But next week could prove
to be a bit more exciting if the cold weather materializes,"" said one
marketer on Friday.  Following last Monday's auction for a 51 percent
ownership stake in the company's trading arm, Enron Corp. chose to have
Swiss Bank UBS Warburg take control of its main energy trading business.
Enron declined to say how much UBS is paying, but company lawyers said they
will release details of the winning bid to a New York bankruptcy judge on
Monday.  The move was designed to restore market confidence in the one-time
gas and electricity marketing giant.  Enron shares were suspended since the
NYSE opened on Friday, pending news on the deal.  Andersen, the accounting
firm for Enron, remains in hot water following news that the firm violated
one of the accounting profession's basic auditing standards by destroying
several Enron documents.  There are still many questions surrounding the
destroyed documents, including who shredded them, when, and exactly why.
The issue has without doubt tarnished the reputation of the accounting firm,
all for the sake of Enron.  Misery loves company.

Heavy load energy costs in the Northwest rose by as much as 2$/MWh for power
to be delivered on Monday, largely the result of forecasted cooling over the
weekend, which was likely to boost demand early in the new week.  ""We're
going to drop back down to more seasonable temperatures over the weekend,
and that means we'll have more heating to contend with,"" said one Northwest
utility trader.  Light load goods rose by an average of 2.5$/MWh on the
anticipated cooling, and partly due to the inclusion of the all-day Sunday
piece.  Flow forecasts for Chief Joseph remained healthy despite a reduction
in runoff, coming in at 60 kcfs Saturday, 50 kcfs Sunday, 95 kcfs Monday,
and 90 kcfs Tuesday through Friday.  In unit news, Colstrip #4 (700 MW) was
back on the grid Friday, but Colstrip #3 (700 MW) was brought down due to
""generator problems.""  While no official ETR was available, sources were
hearing a January 18 return, ""at the earliest.""  Reports indicated that
Wyoming-based Dave Johnston #3 (230 MW) has been down since January 8, and
the return date, which currently sits at January 15, has been pushed back
several times.  Finally, Bridger #3 (520 MW) was scheduled to shut on
Saturday, January 12 for tube leak repairs.  While no official ETR was
available, conventional wisdom suggests a 48 to 72-hour turnaround.  Weather
forecasts for Seattle and Portland were calling for temperatures to dip to
normal levels over the weekend, while the latest six-to-ten from the NWS was
predicting a near-blanketing of below-normal temperatures across the entire
region from January 17 to 21.

Despite little change in temperature forecasts for Monday and weaker gas
prices at the Socal border, electricity prices for the Sunday/Monday package
settled higher in the Golden State on Friday.  ""Sunday's inclusion usually
brings light load prices up, but light load ran up more than I expected at
the end, maybe on the number of units off for the weekend and the colder
weather anticipated in the new week,"" said one California trader.  On-peak
power at SP15 traded between 21.5 and 23$/MWh, while off-peak deals were
done from 14.5 all the way up to 19.5$/MWh, gaining more than 4$/MWh on the
high end.  In unit news, Etiwanda #4 (320 MW) returned to the grid on
Friday, as did larger gas unit Pittsburg #7 (682 MW), down since January 3
for unplanned maintenance.  Off-and-on Moss Landing #6 (739 MW) came down
for unplanned maintenance, while Encina #5 (332 MW) exited for planned
repairs.  Forecasts at mid-state load centers called for temperatures in the
42 to 57 degree range on Monday, about five degrees above normal for this
time of year.  Los Angeles was anticipating highs around 67 degrees and
overnight lows at 51 degrees on Monday, right at seasonal levels.  The most
current six-to-ten called for below-normal temperatures from January 17 to
21.

Day-ahead prices in the Southwest made their typical rise for Sunday/Monday
power, but some parties were surprised by the amount of strength seen.
""Prices were up quite a bit, which surprised me since spot gas was off
slightly today and while temperatures are expected to drop, they should
still remain above normal levels,"" said one Phoenix-based player.  Peak
power at Palo Verde traded from 20.25 to 22.25$/MWh, with the bulk of deals
done at the 21$/MWh mark.  Light load goods ranged from 15 to 18.25$/MWh,
with unconfirmed trades heard as low as 13$/MWh.  In unit news,
Arizona-based Coronado #1 (365 MW) remained off line Friday, but was
expected to ramp up to two thirds load on Saturday, where it will remain for
more repairs until ramping up to full power on January 16.  While most
regional temperatures were expected to remain above or just at normal levels
into the new week, the latest six-to-ten was predicting a round of
below-normal temperatures for the entire desert region from January 17 to
21.

With cooler weather forecast for Monday and a stronger gas market for much
of the day, spot electricity prices traded mostly higher and in tighter
ranges on Friday across the Eastern Interconnect.  However, power prices for
February delivery were mostly down, reflecting a still predominantly bearish
and cautious market.  NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures had posted gains
on Friday, mainly on weekend risk.  The front-month contract edged up 1.9
cents to close at 2.204$/mmBtu, while March picked up an incremental 0.8
cent to end at 2.203$/mmBtu.

An upturn in the gas market, cooler temperatures for the new week, and
stronger real-time prices for much of the day all helped boost peak power
prices for Monday delivery in the Mid-Atlantic on Friday.  Western PJM goods
were bought and sold between 24.55 and 25.1$/MWh, gaining about 2$/MWh at
both ends.  February deals were heard from 25.4 to 25.5$/MWh.  LMPs spent an
hour or more above 37$/MWh on three occasions during the day on Friday,
bringing the average up to 25.11$/MWh through 15:00 EST, a substantial gain
over Thursday's average.  Traders thought an unexpected outage at one of the
Salem units (1,106 MW) was the most likely culprit sending the dailies and
real-time prices higher.  Sources also thought the unit would remain down
into the early part of the new week.  Forecasts for Monday called for
temperatures to remain above normal but below Friday's readings.  Highs were
expected in the 47 to 50 degree range, but lows were expected to dip into
the low-30s, prompting expectations of more overnight heating load in the
new week.  The most current six-to-ten predicted below-normal conditions
from January 17 to 21.

Heavy load electricity prices traded mostly steady and in a narrower range
to a day ago in the Midwest on Friday.  Into Cinergy pieces changed hands
between 16.5 and 18.15$/MWh.  Although the high end was significantly lower,
the bulk of transactions were seen near Thursday's levels.  The February
contract continued to bleed on Friday, with trades heard between 20.9 and
21.3$/MWh.  ""February is hopefully near the low end of where it can trade,
but the physical market is weak, so it all depends on how weather forecasts
and gas do next week,"" commented one forwards trader.  In unit news,
Michigan-based Cook #2 (1,090 MW) was operating at 90% on Friday, joining
fellow nuke LaSalle (1,144 MW) in coasting down towards mid-month refueling
outages.  Temperatures were expected to remain above normal on Monday, with
highs reaching the low-40s and lows mostly in the upper-20s.  The latest
six-to-ten called for below-normal temperatures from January 17 to 21.

Bouyed up by gas gains, peak power prices were steady to slightly higher on
Friday in the Southeast.  No new outages were reported on Friday.
Temperatures were expected to cool somewhat in the new week, but ample
generation kept prices in check.  Highs for Monday and Tuesday were expected
in the mid-50s.  The most current six-to-ten called for below-normal
temperatures from January 17 to 21.

And the Winner Is???

Day-ahead peak power prices in the Western U.S. rose slightly Tuesday on
revised weather forecasts calling for colder temperatures over the next few
days.  The most significant cooling was expected in the Northwest, where
heating demand was forecast to climb to above-normal levels by week's end.
""They've got plenty of hydro in the Northwest and that's what limited the
upside, but that also means there's less power available from the north, so
our prices went up a little as well,"" said one Southern California utility
trader.  Many players anticipated more strength on Wednesday as the colder
weather draws closer, but most expected the upside to be limited due to the
abundant hydropower and relatively soft spot gas prices.  In other industry
news, Weil Gotshal & Manges, the lead law firm for bankrupt Enron, reported
Tuesday that multiple bids had been filed for a controlling stake in Enron
Corp.'s energy trading business.  Weil plans to announce the winning bidder
at its New York offices Thursday, and then present the offer to the U.S.
bankruptcy court in New York for approval on Friday.  Meanwhile, the court
is hearing arguments from creditors on why the case should be transferred to
Texas.  While the bids and the bidders were to remain confidential, it was
reported that Citicorp Inc. and UBS Warburg were among the suitors, though a
third financial institution that had previously expressed interest, J.P.
Morgan Chase & Co., declined to submit a bid by Monday's night's deadline.
British company BP Plc. also said it may be interested in the operations,
and had submitted a bid of $25 million for a small portion of Enron's
assets, including some back office functions and some IT assets.  Enron's
lawyers have stated that the company is not looking for cash bids, but
rather an ownership stake of up to 51 percent.

Heavy load energy costs in the Northwest rose by an average of 1$/MWh for
Wednesday delivery.  Cooler weather forecasts were near-universally blamed
for the rising dailies, though most players conceded that healthy river
flows would limit the upside.  ""The colder weather is a small blessing for
sellers, but also for the region as a whole.  The recent warm weather has
caused some snowmelt, something few people want to see until the spring, and
the lower temperatures should put a stop to that,"" said one Northwest
trader.  According to Weather Derivatives, heating demand in the region was
expected to average 64 percent of normal Wednesday, and then rise to a peak
of 120 percent of normal by Sunday.  Flow forecasts for Chief Joseph were
little changed from a day ago, coming in at 85 kcfs through Friday, 70 kcfs
Saturday, 55 kcfs Sunday, and back up to 85 kcfs next Monday and Tuesday.

Despite lackluster trading and continued mild weather, day-ahead electricity
prices enjoyed a tempered upturn in California on Tuesday.  Gains were
modest, on the order of a dollar everywhere.  Traders cited colder
temperatures on the horizon and an incremental upswing in Western spot gas
prices as the main factors leading prices higher.  ""Balance of the month is
trading at a premium to the dailies, which is usually a sign of coming
strength,"" said one trader.  Peak goods at NP15 were bought and sold between
22.25 and 23.75$/MWh, while the off-peak products changed hands from 16.5 to
18$/MWh.  In political news, the FERC judge for the California refund case
said he will hold evidentiary hearings through July 12, and submit his
proposal to FERC by early August.  The state accuses energy companies of
overcharging during last year's energy crisis, an allegation the companies
deny.  On a less litigious note, last month FERC asked the CAISO to come up
with a detailed plan for reforming the state's energy market.  The proposal
could be unveiled as early as late Tuesday, and would include elements of
the much-admired PJM RTO.  It would also emphasize a way to reduce
intra-zonal congestion and include a plan for a day-ahead market, although
on a smaller scale then the former one run by the CalPX.  There were no
dramatic changes in the generation landscape on Tuesday.  Moss Landing #6
(739 MW) and Etiwanda #4 (320 MW) returned to the grid, while hydro unit Big
Creek Project (1,020 MW) was operating at 970 MW.  On the weather front,
Wednesday forecasts predicted high temperatures in the mid-50s and low-60s
at mid-state load centers, and in the high-60s in the south.  Little change
was expected in temperatures through Saturday.  The most current six-to-ten
called for below-normal temperatures from January 14 to 18.

Heavy load energy costs in the Southwest rose by an average of less than a
dollar on Tuesday, with the modicum of strength chalked up to rising spot
gas prices and cooler temperatures on the horizon.  Peak power at Palo Verde
ranged from 20 to 22$/MWh, with the bulk of transactions seen right in the
middle at 21$/MWh.  Balance-of-January contracts were heard trading at about
a $2/MWh premium to the dailies on Tuesday, likely in reaction to the cooler
forecasts.  In unit news, Coronado #1 (365 MW) was in the process of
restarting Tuesday afternoon, as expected.  Four Corners #5 (750 MW) was
operating at 550 MW Tuesday due to air-preheater problems, with no available
ETR to full.  Weather Derivatives forecast heating demand in the desert
region to climb from its current level of 50 percent of normal, to just
above normal over the coming weekend, but the latest six-to-ten was still
calling for a mix of normal and above-normal temperatures from January 14
through 18.

Amid forecasts for warmer weather on Wednesday and little else changed in
market fundamentals, heavy load energy costs drifted lower across the
Eastern Interconnect on Tuesday.  ""The EIA revised the Q1 electricity demand
estimate downwards today.  That shouldn't really affect the dailies, but
sometimes its what people think will happen that matters more than what
actually does happen,"" suggested one market analyst, who added that he
thought weather was a greater factor in the dip in day-ahead prices.  NYMEX
Henry Hub natural gas futures settled higher on Tuesday.  February gained
0.9 cents to close at 2.281$/mmBtu, while the March contract picked up 2.4
cents to end at 2.285$/mmBtu.

Day-ahead electricity prices softened in the Mid-Atlantic on Tuesday amid
warm weather forecasts for the rest of this week and next, and on light
demand in the region.  Western PJM goods changed hands in a narrow range
between 24.2 and 24.85$/MWh.  According to traders, prices were low out of
the gate, climbed to the peak within an hour, and ended the day back down at
the low end.  No new outage information was available on Tuesday.  High
temperatures were expected in the 45 to 51 degree range in PJM on Wednesday,
and forecast to stay within five degrees of there through Saturday.  The
latest six-to-ten called for normal temperatures from January 14 to 18.

Temperatures in the Midwest were expected to climb to their highest level of
the week on Wednesday, bringing peak power prices down by about a dollar on
Tuesday.  Into Cinergy pieces for Wednesday delivery traded between 19.55
and 21.25$/MWh, dropping 0.75 and 0.95$/MWh off the high and low ends,
respectively.  The February contract gained some support Tuesday morning,
opening strong and climbing to 23.15$/MWh before dropping back down to
22.25$/MWh.  ""Prior to the open, gas looked strong, and people were buying
February to cover their shorts, but gas came off fast and that was the end
of that,"" said one trader of the ill-fated early rally and fizzle.
Temperatures at most ECAR load centers were expected to hit the upper-40s on
Wednesday, with corresponding lows in the mid-30s.  Thursday forecasts
called for temperatures to stay near that level, while Friday was expected
to cool five to seven degrees.  The most current six-to-ten from the NWS
predicted normal temperatures from January 14 to 18.

As natural gas weakness continued to concern Southeastern traders, and
forecasts called for significantly warmer temperatures for the rest of the
week, heavy load electricity prices softened in the Southeast on Tuesday.
Into Entergy deals were done from 19 to 20$/MWh, while Into TVA deals for
Wednesday delivery were heard between 20.25 and 21.5$/MWh.  TVA prices
reached their low late in the day.  In unit news, sources said one of the
Scherer coal units (832, 833, 844, and 844 MW) was off-line but expected
back on Thursday.  The latest six-to-ten called for above-normal
temperatures from January 14 to 18.

Let's meet at Rock Bottom at 11:45 (or we could get all radical and actually leave together from the floor at 11:40) for the celebration.

We could probably figure out how many Kcalories we all burned by riding during September and dedicate ourselves to replacing them at a single sitting!

See you there.





Great work, team--we took the ""total number of trips"" category for the Bike Commute Challenge.

As a reward, we will be treated to lunch at Rock Bottom, courtesy of Enron, sometime during the month of October.

We need to pick a day when we can all get together for that lunch.

I propose one of the following dates, beginning at 11:45 a.m.:  

		T	W	Th	F

		16	17	18
			24	25	26


Please let me know which of these dates you CANNOT make.  If you have a strong preference about another date, let me know that, too.  The date(s) with the the highest possible attendance wins.

Let me know what your preference is.

During the summer, FERC initiated an investigation into the potential of unjust and unreasonable spot prices in the northwest from December of 2000 through June of 2001.  Seatlle City Light, Tacoma City Light, Eugene Water and Electric Board, and Sacramento Municipal Utility District all filed claims at FERC for refunds from EPMI.  The claims totaled close to $100 million.  However, many of these claims were, on their face, spurious.  For example, Eugene Water and Electric Board filed for refund of forward purchases which was clearly outside the scope of FERC's proceeding.

We hired consultants from Charles River Associates (CRA) to help us with this process.  One of their tasks was to apply the CAISO competitive benchmark pricing methodology to the Northwest market.  That is, CRA attempted to reverse engineer the CAISO's methodology in order to estimate our Northwest risk.

I was informed by our litigation team that EPMI's realistic potential exposure using this methodology was roughly $30 million.  We decided to reserve roughly 2/3 of this amount which came to about $21 million.

In September a FERC Adminitrative Law Judge heard the case and submitted a draft decision to the FERC.  The draft decision recommended against any refunds.  This draft decision is supposed to come in front of the FERC commissioners for approval before the end of the year.  If this draft decision is approved, it would be appropriate to remove these reserves."

Western Hangover

With one notable exception, peak power prices slackened across the WSCC on
the first day of trading in the New Year.  Mild coastal and southwestern
weather kept a lid on demand at the region's major load centers, while
generation output levels in California strengthened significantly in
comparison to the holiday doldrums.  Combined with the fact that spot gas
prices were weaker than they were on the last full day of trading, peak
power prices fell anywhere from .25 to 3$/MWh across the West on Wednesday.
The only anomaly in the West was the Central Rockies, where prices for peak
goods shot up by as much as 12.75$/MWh, with high end trades going through
at 37$/MWh.  ""I'm not sure why it was so expensive here today,"" responded
one trader to a request for an explanation. ""Temperatures are really cold,
and unit outages are up, but other than that, I wouldn't be able to guess.""
The low temperature in Denver was a frosty six degrees on Wednesday, though
the five-day forecast called for temperatures to warm into near normal
territory by Sunday.  Meanwhile, on NYMEX, Henry Hub natural gas futures
fell on Wednesday.  The February contract dropped 10.5 cents to settle at
2.465$/mmBtu, while March slid 11.7 cents to close at 2.443$/mmBtu.

Across the Northwest, peak power prices for Thursday delivery softened from
1.5 to 3$/MWh.  Peak goods changed hands from 22 to 24$/MWh.  Temperatures
were mild on Wednesday, and well above average west of the Cascades, with
highs in the low 50s and partly cloudy skies.  East of the Cascades
temperatures were near freezing but still slightly above normal, while the
five-day forecast called for temperatures to heat up slightly through
Sunday.  The latest six-to-ten predicted temperatures near to above normal
from January 8 to 12.  Flow forecasts for Chief Joseph were revised
significantly upward over the long holiday weekend, coming in at 105 kcfs
Thursday and Friday, 75 kcfs Saturday, 60 kcfs Sunday, 110 kcfs Monday, and
105 kcfs Tuesday through next Wednesday.  In unit news, Montana coal-burner
Colstrip #4 (740 MW) returned to the grid Tuesday night after making
unplanned repairs.

As weather too warm to trigger heating demand lingered in the Golden State
and generation became healthier, power prices for Thursday delivery weakened
in the first trading session of 2002.  In a generally quiet, low-offer day,
market players reported trading at NP15 was especially light, as a soft spot
market in the Northwest pulled it down.  ""The market had a cautious tenor
today, but besides the new calendar there wasn't a particular reason for
 it,"" mentioned one undisturbed California marketer.  Peak goods at SP15
changed hands between 26.5 and 28.5$/MWh, with most deals done from 27 to
27.5$/MWh.  Light load pieces traded in a wider range from 19.5 to
23.25$/MWh, with unconfirmed trades heard as low as 18$/MWh.  A proposal for
more than 31 miles of new transmission lines in southern California, running
between the SCE grid and San Diego Gas & Electric, moved forward on
Wednesday.  The new capacity is needed to meet San Diego's swift-approaching
projected power shortfall.  Currently, the U.S. Department of the Interior
is studying the environmental effects of the proposal.  In unit news, a bevy
of returning units boosted generation in California.  Gas-fired Alamitos #6
(480 MW), Alamitos #4 (320 MW), El Segundo #3 (337 MW), and Morro Bay #4
(336 MW) were back in service on December 29, December 31, and the latter
two on January 1, respectively.  New additions to the out of service column
included Moss Landing #7 (739 MW) and Morro Bay #3 (337 MW).  Finally,
Calpine's Sutter Plants (546 MW) tripped off-line December 29, but was back
the following day.  Forecasts for Thursday called for above-normal
temperatures in the middle and northern sections of California, with highs
in the 57-59 degree range and lows around 50 degrees.  Los Angeles expected
highs in the mid-60s.  Little change was expected through the weekend across
the entire state, and the latest six-to-ten predicted above-normal
temperatures from January 8 to 12.

Despite a rash of unit outages, prices for peak goods weakened by up to
2$/MWh in the Southwest on milder weather and falling demand.  Peak pieces
at Palo Verde traded from 25 to 27.5$/MWh.  Temperatures across the region
hovered around normal, though the five-day forecast predicted some slight
cooling through Sunday.  The latest six-to-ten predicted temperatures to
remain near to above normal from January 8 through 12.  On the unit front,
coal unit Mohave #2 (442 MW) tripped off-line on December 27 for unplanned
repairs.  There was no ETR available.  Fellow coal-combustor Cholla #4 (375
MW) came off-line early January 1 for undisclosed reasons and was expected
back in a few days, while Navajo #3 (750 MW) came off line on New Year's Eve
with a tube leak but was back on-line by New Year's Day.  Meanwhile,
Coronado #1 (365 MW) continued to have problems with its main transformer.
It has been off the grid since December 22.

Eastern Markets Pre-Scheduled Firm Power Prices ($/MWh)

January 2, 2002 for January 3, 2002

Peak (Heavy) in $/MWh
                 Low     Change   High      Change
Into Cinergy    24.00     2.25    30.50      5.50

Into TVA        24.00     4.10    26.00      5.90
___________________________________________________________
As temperatures plunged and loads climbed in the new year, peak power prices
settled higher across the Eastern Interconnect on Wednesday, breaking the
30$/MWh mark in some places.  ""Trading was brisk today, with pricing
following weather and loads up.   Loads were higher than expected, I think,
and some units are still down from the holidays,"" said one Eastern trader.
""There was a run-up at the end of trading,"" commented a Midwestern dealer.
NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures slipped on Wednesday, with the
front-month contract losing 10.5 cents to close at 2.465$/mmBtu.  March fell
a similar 11.7 cents to end at 2.443$/mmBtu.

Facing a key unit outage and temperatures well below freezing, heavy load
energy costs strengthened in the Mid-Atlantic on Wednesday.  Western PJM
goods changed hands between 28.85 and 31$/MWh, up from Monday trading in the
low 28s.  According to traders, the bulk of transactions went through around
29.5$/MWh, with offers at 31$/MWh accepted late.  In unit news, traders
thought nuke Salem #2 (1,106 MW), down since the weekend, remained out of
service on Wednesday, despite hopes it would be back on-line Tuesday.
However, no official confirmation of the outage was available.  LMPs
fluctuated sharply and remained above 30$/MWh for the first part of the
morning, but were averaging 26.47$/MWh through 15:00 EST.  High temperatures
were expected to stay in the mid-30s on Thursday, with lows in the mid-20s.
Little change was forecast for Friday, and slight warming, with highs
breaking into the 40s, was predicted for the weekend.  The latest six-to-ten
called for normal temperatures from January 8 to 12.

Peak electricity prices rose in the Midwest on Wednesday, as colder weather
drove energy demand up on the first business day after the New Year's
holiday.  Into Cinergy pieces were bought and sold between 24 and 30.5$/MWh,
with the high end reached late in the session, but traders were uncertain as
to why prices jumped.  ""New Year, new load,"" summed up one happy Midwestern
seller.  Cold weather was expected to keep the Midwest firmly locked in its
grip on Thursday, with highs forecast right at freezing and lows in the
mid-teens.  The mercury was expected to rise into the high-30s Saturday.
The most current six-to-ten from the NWS predicted mostly above-normal
temperatures, with normal forecasts for southern ECAR, from January 8 to 12.

After weeks in the price doldrums, day-ahead electricity prices in the
Southeast finally showed some strength on Wednesday, pulled up by the
bullish fundamental of cold weather.  Into Entergy deals were done between
23.25 and 25.25$/MWh, gaining almost 2$/MWh on the high end.  Contrary to
the norm, spot power prices Into TVA carried a premium to the Entergy hub,
with goods trading between 24 and 26$/MWh.  Forecasts called for snow and
cold temperatures across much of the deep South.  Overnight lows in the
mid-20s and highs in the mid-30s were expected on Thursday, with
temperatures expected to remain well below normal through the weekend.  The
latest six-to-ten called for normal and below-normal temperatures from
January 8 to 12.

> Notice of Incorporated Terms
> 
> Transportation to be provided between points in the U.S. (including its
> overseas territories and possessions) is subject to the individual terms
> of the transporting air carriers.  These terms are incorporated herein by
> reference, and are made part of the contract of carriage between the
> airline and the passenger.
> 
> Incorporated terms may include but are not restricted to:
> (1) Limits on liability for personal injury or death.  (2) Limits on
> liability for baggage, including fragile or perishable goods and
> availability of excess valuation coverage.  (3) Claims restrictions,
> including time periods in which passengers must file a claim or bring an
> action against the carrier. (4) Rights of the air carrier to change the
> terms of the contract.  (5) Rules on reconfirmation of reservations,
> check-in times, and refusal to carry. (6) Rights of the air carrier and
> limits on liability for delay or failure to perform service, including
> schedule changes, substitution of alternative air carriers or aircraft or
> rerouting.  (7) This document is good for carriage for one year from date
> of issue, except as otherwise provided in this document, in carrier's
> tariffs, conditions of carriage, or related regulations.
> 
> You can obtain additional information on items 1 through 7 above at any
> U.S. location where the transporting air carrier's tickets are sold.  You
> have the right to inspect the full text of each transportation air
> carrier's terms at its airport and city ticket offices.  You also have the

> Notice of Baggage Liability Limitations
> 
> Liability for loss, delay, or damage to baggage is limited as follows
> unless a higher value is declared in advance and additional charges are
> paid:
> (1) for travel wholly between U.S. points, to $2500 per passenger on most
> carriers (a few have lower limits); (2) for most international travel
> (including domestic portions of international journeys), to approximately
> $9.07 per pound ($20.00) per kilo for checked baggage and $400 per
> passenger for unchecked baggage. Pursuant to American's (and American
> Eagle's) tariff regulations, the weight of each piece of checked baggage
> will be deemed to be the maximum acceptable weight for the passenger's
> destination, unless the actual weight has been [stated on the passenger
> ticket].  This creates a maximum liability for international travel to or
> from a U.S. point of $634.90 per piece of checked baggage.  This liability
> limit may be lower for additional pieces or where the passenger utilizes
> connecting carriers.  Excess valuation may not be declared on certain
> types of articles.
> CARRIERS ASSUME NO RESPONSIBILITY OR LIABIITY FOR FRAGILE OR PERISHABLE
> ARTICLES.  AMERICAN (AMERICAN EAGLE) ASSUMES NO RESPONSIBILITY OR
> LIABILITY FOR JEWELRY, CASH, CAMERAS, VIDEO AND ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT,

> PUBLICATIONS OR SIMILAR VALUABLES CONTAINED IN CHECKED OR UNCHECKED
> BAGGAGE.
> These items as well as medication and prescriptions should be carried
> personally by you.  American (American Eagle) assumes no responsibility or
> liability for baggage carried in the passenger compartment of the aircraft
> on flights wholly between U.S. points.  Baggage is designed to protect the

> Baggage should be locked.  Checked baggage must have the passenger's name
> on the outside.  American does not assume liability for normal wear and

> 
> Notice
> 
> If the passenger's journey involves an ultimate destination or stay in a
> country other than the country departure, the Warsaw Convention, and
> special contracts of carriage embodied in applicable tariffs, will govern
> and, in most cases, will limit the liability of carriers for death or
> personal injury and in respect of loss or damage to baggage.  See also

> We overbook.  If a flight is overbooked, no one will be denied a seat
> until airline personnel first ask for volunteers willing to give up their
> reservation in exchange for payment of the airline's choosing.  If there

MWHRs =  4 Years and 1 quarter Flat so that equals approximately 37,250 Hours

The difference between 102 (the new amount) and 94.5 (the old average flat amount) = 7.5 MW * 37,250 HRs = 279,375 MWhrs

I was under the impression that a 100 MW flat amount would equal $3 million value (a $16 difference between market and $21.50).  This would indicate the 102 equals a $4,100,000 valuation.  As to the discount in value due to the flexibility and delivery point I am looking to you for leadership.  If my assumptions are wrong then let me know.

Subject:	Luscar/USW update

There have been few developments since the start of the strike so it has
been a while since the last update.  Below is the current status:

     The Alberta Labour Relations Board (ALRB) has determined that pickets
     on the plant gates as occurred during the first 3 days of the strike
     and disrupted TransAlta operations are not allowed.
     Luscar is fulfilling their responsibility to supply fuel to
     TransAlta's Sundance and Keephills plants through the implementation
     of their contingency plans.
     Inventories used to supply the units when mine operations are slowed
     remain at adequate levels.
     The most significant impact to date has been to coal blending
     operations.  Suboptimum blending results in derates.  Challenges in
     this area are expected to continue for the duration of the strike and
     likely several days thereafter.
     Risks to plant and mine operations from the strike exist.  Luscar and
     TransAlta have plans in place to address these risks but there are no
     guarantees that output will be maintained at current levels.  It is
     our objective to adapt operations to minimize the impact of these
     events which are outside of our control and to meet our PPA
     obligations as much of the time as possible.

We understand Luscar and the USW will be meeting later today.

Should the situation change as a result of the meeting or any other
consequential developments I will send another e-mail within a few hours,
including over the weekend.

Regards,
Jim"

We expected this, because it is not unusual to be downgraded after using assets to secure credit.  This is still above investment grade.

The ratings of our pipelines Northern Natural Gas and Transwestern have also been lowered from A- to BBB.  In S&P's words, ""Their ratings [are now] in line with those of the parent company to reflect S&P's view that Enron's pipeline assets have become more strategic to the company.""

S&P also said, ""[We continue] to believe that Enron's liquidity position is adequate to see the company through the current period of uncertainty, and that the company is working to provide itself with an even greater liquidity cushion through additional bank lines and pending asset sales.""

As I've said before, building on our liquidity position through additional credit lines maintains our counterparties' confidence and strengthens our core businesses.

It's important for you to know that our gas and power numbers - which account for more than 95 percent of our trading activity - indicate that our customer base is not withdrawing, closing out positions, or reducing transaction levels as a result of credit concerns.  In fact, EnronOnline trading volumes are currently experiencing above-normal activity.

Dreaming of a Wet Christmas

As reduced holiday demand prepared to firmly grip the U.S., peak power
prices for delivery on Sunday and Christmas Eve fell sharply throughout the
West on Thursday.  The most notable declines were seen in the southern half
of the WSCC as temperatures remained at or just above normal levels, while
much of the Northwest and Northern California combated increasing heating
demand.  ""Lower spot gas prices may have played a role in softening the
dailies, but holiday loads are the main market-moving force,"" admitted one
trader.  NYMEX Henry Hub futures contracts rose Thursday on forecasts
calling for end-of-the-month cold in the Midwest and Northeast, though most
players believed that weak holiday demand would limit the upside in the near
term.  January Hub gas, which expires next Thursday, rose 7 cents to close
at 2.686$/mmBtu, and February gained 5.8 cents to end at 2.708$/mmBtu.  ""The
forecasted cold for the eastern half of the U.S. may well have pushed Henry
Hub prices much higher had it not been for the glut of gas currently in
storage,"" said one gas watcher.  Over the past several weeks, the Western
U.S. has led the nation in inventory withdrawls, largely due to colder
weather in the region relative to the rest of the nation.  Several sources
indicated that the ""strong Western draws"" were due in part to a large number
of unit outages, especially at coal-fired plants, which increased the demand
for natural gas.  The recent return of more than 1,000 MW of coal-fired
generation, however, will likely reduce demand for natural gas going
forward.  Natural gas demand will likely be reduced further by the recent
precipitation.  Not only does the heavy precipitation lend to stronger hydro
generation now, but higher snow-pack will likely boost hydro output when the
spring runoff takes place.  ""All these factors lead me to believe that the
demand for gas-fired generation in the West will remain weak well into
 2002,"" said one market analyst.

Heavy load energy costs for Christmas Eve delivery fell by an average of
3.25$/MWh in the Northwest on Thursday, but the decline was limited by
colder temperatures across much of the region.  Peak power at the
Mid-Columbia traded in a relatively narrow range from 19 to 21$/MWh, while
light load goods for the all-day Sunday/off-peak Christmas Eve package were
seen in an even tighter range between 17 and 18$/MWh.  ""I'm not sure why
they treated Christmas Eve as a peak power day.  I don't know anyone who
will be working on Monday,"" said one baffled trader.  Flow forecasts for
Chief Joseph remained strong amid recent heavy precipitation, coming in at
95 kcfs Friday, 75 kcfs Saturday, 60 kcfs Sunday, 75 kcfs Christmas Eve, 60
kcfs Christmas Day, and 90 kcfs next Wednesday and Thursday.  Recent heavy
rains have all but quashed a year-long drought in the region.  With the
shortest day of the year upon us, Portland, Oregon was enjoying its 32nd day
of continuous rain.  That leaves only three more days of Mother Nature's
revenge to break the record of 34 days. Precipitation since October 1 has
ranged from 124 to 143% of normal in the Cascades and northern Sierra Nevada
Mountains.  Canadian precipitation is back on track too, with snow-pack
levels in the Columbia River drainage at or above normal.  Last year's
drought, frigid weather, and market panic are merely distant memories.

Peak power prices for the Sunday-Monday package weakened across the Golden
State on Thursday in what marketers described as a ""cold, wet, uneventful
trading day.""  The all-day Sunday/off-peak Monday piece lost ground at every
California hub, with SP-15 the biggest mover.  ""There's just no demand over
the holidays, especially with this mild weather,"" lamented one overstocked
seller.  Above-normal precipitation and temperatures in the low 50s to
mid-60s were the most-oft cited targets for blame, according to market
players.  The five-day forecast called for temperatures in the western
portions of California to be near or slightly below normal, while the
eastern portions were expected to be slightly above normal.  Rain was
predicted for the coastal and lowland regions, with snow called for in the
mountains.  The latest six-to-ten suggested that temperatures would fall
below normal from December 26 to 30.  In unit news, gas-burner Los Medanos
(550 MW) had already powered up to 530 MW following an unplanned outage, and
Contra Costa #7 (337 MW) was ramping down for a planned maintenance outage.
It had powered down to 45 MW as of the CAISO's 11:15 report.

Relatively mild weather and meek holiday demand prompted spot electricity
prices in the Southwest to make the sharpest declines in the West on
Thursday.  Peak power for Christmas Eve fell by as much as a whopping
6.5$/MWh at Palo Verde, with confirmed trades heard anywhere between 22.25
and 25$/MWh.  A very late trade reported at 29.25$/MWh was no more than an
anomaly.  Light load goods at the Southwest hub traded narrowly between 14
and 16$/MWh.  In unit news, Mohave #1 (739 MW) was still scheduled to return
from the dead at 22:00 MST Thursday, but even unit participants were taking
a wait-and-see attitude.  Further to the north, Utah-based Hunter #2 (472
MW) had its return pushed back until at least Christmas Day.  Weather
forecasts called for temperatures in Phoenix to hover within a few degrees
of normal through the long holiday weekend, while the latest six-to-ten from
the NWS was predicting a mix of normal and below-normal conditions across
the desert region from December 26 through 30.

Amid light pre-holiday trading and higher natural gas prices, day-ahead
electricity prices were mixed across the Eastern Interconnect on Thursday.
With many traders already off for the holiday and light loads expected to
continue through the end of the year, volume was particularly thin and
prices were seen in tight ranges.  ""There's a piece trading here and there,
but for the most part business is done until January,"" said one PJM trader.
NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures climbed on Thursday, with the January
contract gaining 7 cents to close 2.686$/mmBtu and the February contract
following suit with a 5.8 cent gain to close at 2.708$/mmBtu.

Despite less generation on-line than a day ago, peak power prices settled
lower on Thursday in the Mid-Atlantic.  ""Some plants are off to give
everyone a holiday break, which is possible because the weather's not
expected to do much,"" said one ready-to-leave PJM player.   Western PJM
heavy-load goods traded between 24.25 and 24.5$/MWh, slipping 65 cents at
both ends.  Light load deals for Friday delivery were heard from 16.75 to
17$/MWh.  LMPs spiked to an unusually hefty 100$/MWh briefly at 08:00 and
again just before 09:00 EST, before settling back near the day's average of
23.06$/MWh through 14:00 EST.  Forecasts in the Mid-Atlantic called for
temperatures to linger within 5 degrees of seasonal levels.  Friday highs
were expected in the 41 to 48 degree range, with overnight lows just below
freezing.  Low temperatures were predicted to warm into the low-40s by
Christmas Eve.  The latest six-to-ten from the NWS called for near to
below-normal temperatures from December 26 to 30.

In sparse dealing, heavy load electricity prices in the Midwest fell off a
bit on Thursday, as weather, loads, and the attitudes of those still stuck
at work on Friday were expected to be bearish.  Into Cinergy goods changed
hands between 20.75 and 21.75$/MWh, gaining 75 cents on the low end and
losing almost the same off the high to settle into a dollar spread.  No new
unit information was available on Thursday.  High temperatures were expected
mostly in the 40s through Sunday, while cooling into the mid-30s was
predicted for Christmas Eve, boosting the hopes of those still dreaming of a
white Christmas.  The most current six-to-ten-day forecast called for near
to below-normal temperatures from December 26 to 30.

Peak power prices strengthened in the Southeast on Thursday for the third
day in a row, as colder weather forecasts and higher natural gas prices
rallied the dailies.  Into Entergy deals were done between 22 and
23.25$/MWh, with the bulk of transactions near 22.75$/MWh.  Into TVA trading
was much lighter, with pieces being bought and sold between 21 and 22$/MWh.
Although no official word was heard, traders thought Catawba #2 (1,129 MW)
remained down.  High temperatures were expected to range from 47 to 57
degrees through Christmas Eve, with overnight lows in the mid-30s to
low-40s.  The latest six-to-ten called for near to below-normal temperatures
from December 26 to 30.

FERC has posted its agenda.  It is available at
http://cips.ferc.gov/Q\CIPS\MISC\CA\CA121901.000.TXT.

Here comes the Federal Regulatory Santa Claus?  FERC's agenda for its 12/19
meeting is incredibly ambitious and appears to have queued up a large swath
of high profile cases.  To speculate based upon the current, end-of-the-year
agenda, it appears that there will be orders regarding RTOs at center stage,
with a twist of congestion mitigation thrown in (?).  Interconnection issues
also come up, including the CA dockets.  There's also an order coming in the
California docket, but its not that clear whether this addresses the gross
load issue, outage coordination, the must-offer requirement, or some other
facet of the ""market mitigation"" docket.  RMR contract updates and the
various protests also come up for consideration.

Here is an update of some recent Enron developments.

Enron Europe Closes Certain Operations

Following Enron's credit rating downgrade yesterday and the impact that had on Enron Europe's ability to trade, Enron Europe has asked a court to appoint an Administrator.  What this means is that PricewaterhouseCoopers has been appointed the Administrator to handle the liquidation of the company's major physical assets and trading positions.  This action does not include Enron Credit, Enron Direct, Enron Metals, Teesside Power Station or the utilities and service businesses at the Wilton chemical complex.  It also does not include Wessex Water or power plants in Turkey, Italy and Poland.

Efforts are being made to preserve as much of the business as possible.  There is already interest by outside parties to buy Enron Europe's metals business, and negotiations are expected to lead to a successful deal in the near term.

This action will impact a significant number of Enron Europe's employees.  Every effort is being made to retain as many employees as possible who are part of businesses that may be preserved.

Enron Appoints New Board Member

Yesterday, Enron announced the election of Raymond S. Troubh to the Board of Directors.  Mr. Troubh will chair a newly-formed Special Litigation Committee of the Board to evaluate claims in shareholder and other derivative lawsuits.  He will also serve on the Special Committee set up to investigate all of the SEC-related matters.  Mr. Troubh is a financial consultant in New York City and has been a non-executive director of more than 25 public companies.  Board member William C. Powers, Jr. will also serve on the Special Litigation Committee.

Enron Evaluates Dividends

Today Enron announced that it is evaluating whether previously declared dividends will be paid on Enron common stock and other Enron equities.

From ENE to ENRNQ to EBAY

Heavy load electricity prices in the Western U.S. continued their recent
rise amid ongoing below-normal temperatures and curtailed generation.  Some
parties also believed that stronger spot gas prices played a role in
strengthening up the Thursday/Friday package.  ""The curtailment at Diablo
Canyon caused a chain reaction of higher prices around the West today.  We
have below-normal temperatures everywhere, and California is having to
import lots of power from outside the state,"" said one marketer.  In fact,
there was some talk that reserves in the Golden State could fall below
acceptable levels Wednesday evening, possibly leading to the first emergency
declaration since July 3, 2001.  NYMEX Henry Hub gas futures ended higher on
Wednesday, but displayed little reaction to the late release of the AGA
weekly storage report.  February gained 10.3 cents to close at 2.394$/mmBtu,
while March ended 9 cents higher at 2.363$/mmBtu.  The AGA inventory report
indicated that 137 bcf were pulled out of storage last week, right in line
with most industry estimates.  Total U.S. inventories stood at 2.529 tcf,
1.070 tcf, or 73 percent, above last year and 529 bcf above the five-year
average.  Of the 137 bcf drawn last week, only seven were taken out of the
Western Consuming Region, but recent cold weather had many players convinced
that next week's report would show a much larger draw in the West.  In other
industry gossip, David Duncan, the lead Andersen partner in charge of the
Enron audit who was fired on Tuesday, met for several hours Wednesday with
lawyers and House of Energy and Commerce Committee staff.  The House Energy
committee was also looking to interview Sherron Watkins, the Enron executive
who wrote the prophetic letter last summer to Ken Lay warning him of big
troubles with the company's accounting policies.  Meanwhile, Enron shares
were trading on the Pink Sheets, an over-the-counter market in which
companies do not have to report financial performance.  On Wednesday, Enron
stock, which now trades under the symbol ""enrnq"", fell 20 cents to close at
31 cents.  Meanwhile, Enron stock certificates were selling for upwards of
$100 on Ebay due to their collectable value.  Quite a paradox, eh?

Heavy load energy costs in the Northwest gained 1.25$/MWh on the high end,
largely due to cold temperatures locally, and reports of increased exports
to California.  Peak power at the Mid-Columbia ranged from 20 to 22.75$/MWh,
with the bulk of trades between 21.25 and 21.5$/MWh.  Flow forecasts for
Chief Joseph remained strong at 100 kcfs Thursday, 95 kcfs Friday, 65 kcfs
Saturday, 55 kcfs Sunday, 100 kcfs Monday, and 95 kcfs next Tuesday and
Wednesday.  In unit news, Colstrip #3 and #4 (700 MW each) remained off
line, both with a revised ETR of January 20.  Wyoming-based Naughton #3 (330
MW) also had its return date backed up until January 18.  Weather forecasts
were calling for below-normal temperatures to continue through the weekend,
while the latest six-to-ten from the NWS was calling for below-normal
temperatures across the entire region from January 22 through 26.

Amid predictions of cold weather on Thursday, rumors of reserves falling
below WSCC required levels, and stronger natural gas values, electricity
prices for the Thursday/Friday package strengthened on Wednesday in the
Golden State.  ""Prices opened strong, but slid off some later.  There was
some excitement over the cold weather and stronger loads, and talk that the
CAISO safety margin might not be met across the peak tonight.  It's been a
while since we've seen emergency stages and out of market buying in
California,"" said one interested party.  Heavy load trades at SP15 were
heard from 28 to 30$/MWh, while light loads goods were being exchanged
between 18 and 19.75$/MWh, with odd-lot products heard at 17 and 20.25$/MWh.
In political news, PG&E ran a full page ad in the major California papers on
Wednesday, accusing the state of filing suit to stop the utility's
reorganization process and staunchly defending their own business practices
as ""ethical and fair"".  In unit news, Pittsburg #7 (682 MW) was down on
Wednesday, as was El Segundo #3 (337 MW).  Alamitos #4 (320 MW) returned to
the grid.   Temperatures were expected to dip just below freezing in the
capital and other mid-state interior load centers on Thursday.  The Bay Area
and southern regions of the state were only expecting lows in the upper-30s
to mid-40s.  Little change was forecast through Sunday, and the most current
six-to-ten called for below-normal temperatures from January 22 to 26.

Below-normal temperatures and increased demand from California helped to
boost day-ahead peak power prices in the Southwest by as much as 3$/MWh on
Wednesday.  ""They're [California] hurting for power today, and we've even
been asked to turn on some of our gas units to help get them through the
evening peak,"" said one Southwest utility trader.  Peak power at Palo Verde
saw action from 26 to 30.5$/MWh, with most trades heard in the 28.5 to
29$/MWh range.  Prices generally started on the low end, but quickly
ratcheted up as California players came out of the woodwork looking to
gobble up surplus supplies.  The latest six-to-ten from the NWS was calling
for below-normal temperatures to continue from January 22 through 26.

Eastern Markets Pre-Scheduled Firm Power Prices ($/MWh)

January 16, 2002 for January 17, 2002

Peak (Heavy) in $/MWh
                 Low     Change   High      Change
Into Cinergy    19.35     1.60    22.00      3.25

___________________________________________________________
As stronger natural gas prices, unit curtailments, and winter weather made
their presence felt, day-ahead electricity prices settled slightly higher
across the Eastern Interconnect on Wednesday.  While temperatures remained
cool, there was little change in the weather pattern since Tuesday, which
left traders perplexed about the source of Wednesday's strength,
particularly in the Midwest.  The AGA's weekly storage report listed a
withdrawal of 137 bcf, dead on with industry estimates of 135 to 140 bcf.
The AGA had little influence on late trading, and NYMEX Henry Hub gas
futures rose on Wednesday.  February gained 10.3 cents to close at
2.394$/mmBtu, while March rose 9 cents to end at 2.363$/mmBtu.

As imports dropped and rumors of output constraints on the PJM grid were
heard, peak power prices exhibited some tempered strength in the
Mid-Atlantic on Wednesday.  Western PJM goods for Thursday delivery changed
hands between 23.1 and 23.6$/MWh.  While sources were fairly certain that
the Salem and Keystone outages were finished, rumors circulated that a
different Pennsylvania unit was newly off-line on Wednesday, but no one was
certain exactly which one.  After a promising early spike to 80 and a two
hour mid-morning plateau above 30, LMPs settled lower for the afternoon and
averaged 26.05$/MWh through 15:00 EST.  High temperatures were expected in
the upper-40s on Thursday and lows were forecast in the mid-30s.  Cooling of
about five degrees was expected through Sunday, and the most current
six-to-ten called for normal temperatures in the north of PJM and
above-normal temperatures in the south from January 22 to 26.

Amid official word of a big nuke off the grid and higher natural gas prices,
heavy load energy costs gained significant ground in the Midwest on
Wednesday.  Into Cinergy day-ahead pieces were bought and sold from 19.35 to
22$/MWh, picking up over 3$/MWh on the high end.  The February contract also
traded much higher, with deals heard between 20.9 to 21.45$/MWh, up almost a
dollar to a day ago.  In unit news, Exelon confirmed the outage at their
Illinois Quad Cities #1 (821 MW) on Wednesday.  The unit has been down since
January 9 for repairs to a pump in the reactor vessel.  However, no ETR was
given.  High temperatures were forecast to reach the mid-30s on Thursday,
with overnight lows in the mid-20s.  The latest six-to-ten called for mostly
above-normal temperatures from January 22 to 26.

Peak power prices were steady to slightly higher in the Southeast on
Wednesday.  Into Entergy trades were seen between 19 and 22$/MWh, slipping
towards the low end as the day progressed, while the front month contract
saw action mostly between 20.25 and 20.4$/MWh.  Into TVA deals were done
between 20 and 22.25$/MWh.  High temperatures were anticipated mostly in the
50s across SERC on Thursday, with little change expected through Sunday.
The most current six-to-ten called for above-normal temperatures from
January 22 to 26.

For your discussions with PacifiCorp we are pricing up the 100% Coullee product only. It didn't appear beneficial to offer a very high price on the multi-stream deal that we really don't have a way to hedge.  Glenn is looking into the dual trigger pricing models that we used a year ago that actually settle vs. the power price trigger rather than 100% of the power value. This should be less expensive and more appropriately match PacifiCorp's risk exposure (i.e. combination of low water, high prices).

Good luck with the meeting.

Greg

Greg:

As per discussions, if possible let's price:

The structure as per deal sheet. PacifiCorp tells me that they have done half piece (that's what is in the term sheet) at $1.5 million per year for five years. I know for sure that the volume is same but I am not sure about caps. Our simulations are app. $2 to $2.5 million, assuming 2001 as the worst year in last 30 years and that impact of deficit is carried forward.

Alternate structure that we are comfortable with. As per PacifiCorp, they are open to an alternate structure but they would like to include Coulee, as this is the largest 
exposure to them (and we are ok with this as well). Another change can be an introduction of strikes on both sides e.g. $25/MWh or $/50/MWh.

Let's talk on Monday and go through the results. I would be in Portland on Tuesday and will work with Mike and Glenn to finalize the numbers.

Thanks again for your help,

Sanjeev

The Return of Enron?

While some Western hubs saw spot electricity prices for the Friday/Saturday
package that were higher than those seen for Thursday power, the bulk of
transactions took place at lower levels due to reduced weekend demand.
Light load goods on the other hand were the real movers of the day thanks to
below-normal temperatures, with all Western hubs gaining ground, especially
late in the session.  ""There were not a lot of off-peak offers out there
today, and we were trying to pick pieces up in order to displace some of our
more expensive gas units,"" said one utility trader to explain Thursday's
light load rally.  The Andersen accounting firm came under heavy fire as
former partner David Duncan refused to testify in Congress on the shredding
of documents related to the Enron collapse by invoking his Constitutional
right not to incriminate himself.  ""Enron robbed the bank, Arthur Andersen
provided the getaway car and they say you were at the wheel,"" the
subcommittee chairman, Rep. Jim Greenwood, R-Pa., told Duncan.  Meanwhile,
top Andersen executives said that the destruction of documents being sought
by investigators was wrong and largely the fault of Duncan.  UBS-Warburg
took a step towards restarting the acquired North American energy trading
unit of Enron Corp. on Thursday.  UBS management asked all Enron employees
that had accepted offers to attend an impromptu orientation meeting in
Houston.  ""Our goal is to reestablish the business,"" said UBS spokesman
David Walker.  ""The buildup will be measured and focused on customer needs.""
UBS has no intention of buying any of Enron's current trading positions,
which are in the process of being liquidated following Enron's December 2
bankruptcy filing.

Heavy load energy costs in the Northwest were as much as 75 cents higher
than levels seen for Thursday, though most deals got done at a discount to
the previous day.  Peak power at the Mid-Columbia ranged from 18.5 to
19.75$/MWh, with the weighted average coming in somewhere around 18.75$/MWh.
Light load electricity at the Mid-C gained an average of 50 cents for the
weekend package, with most players citing cold overnight temperatures as the
catalyst.  Light load energy changed hands from 16.5 to 17.5$/MWh, with
unconfirmed trades heard as high as 18.5$/MWh.  In unit news, Colstrip #3
(700 MW) remained off line for generator repairs, with no available ETR.
According to Weather Derivatives, heating demand in the region was forecast
to be 141 percent of normal through the end of the month, with the strongest
demand expected over the first three days of next week.

Heavy load energy prices softened while light load values appreciated in the
Golden State on Thursday.  ""The market seemed unresponsive to factors that
normally affect it today.  Light load was really strong in the south, so
maybe someone got caught short,"" speculated one California player, while
another trader pointed to upcoming outages in the Southwest.  Peak power
prices at NP15 ranged from 22.25 to 23$/MWh, with shaped pieces heard at
23.5$/MWh.  Light load traded between 17.75 and 20.5$/MWh, running up as the
day progressed.  Similarly, Light load at SP15 traded from 18.75 to
20.5$/MWh, with unconfirmed deals heard as low as 16.5$/MWh early.  In
political news, PG&E will face a critical hearing on Friday in bankruptcy
court.  Judge Montali could decide whether the utility can reform into four
separate companies and if key assets like the Diablo Canyon nukes can be
transferred to one of the proposed companies outside the jurisdiction of the
CPUC.  On the generation front, Alamitos #3 (320 MW) was operating at 240 MW
on Thursday, returning to the grid from an outage that began Monday.
Etiwanda #3 (320 MW) was only operating at 20 megawatts Thursday for planned
maintenance.  Mid-state load centers were expecting high temperatures to
remain in the low-50s on Friday, while highs in the mid-60s were anticipated
in L.A.  Slight cooling was projected for the early part of the new week and
the latest six-to-ten called for below-normal temperatures from January 30
to February 3.

Light load energy costs in the Southwest gained as much as 2.5$/MWh for the
Friday/Saturday package, though some players were at a loss to explain why.
""It's cold here, but not that cold, so I'm not really sure why off-peak
prices gained so much momentum late in today's session,"" said one
Phoenix-based trader.  Light load goods at Palo Verde were seen as low as
14.5$/MWh first thing in the morning, then soared all the way up to
18.75$/MWh by the end of trading.  Peak power at Palo Verde ranged from
20.25 to 22.25$/MWh, with the bulk of trades taking place between 21.25 and
21.5$/MWh.  In unit news, Utah-based Bonanza (425 MW) and Arizona-based
Cholla #4 (380 MW) were off line Thursday morning, but both had returned by
the afternoon.  Utah-based Huntington #2 (455 MW), however, was down with a
tube leak.  While no ETR was available, sources were expecting a 48 to
72-hour turnaround.  Navajo #3 (750 MW) was experiencing vibration problems
on a PA fan.  The Arizona-based unit was scheduled to come down for 24 hours
of repairs beginning after Friday's evening peak.

___________________________________________________________
Amid forecasts calling for cooler weather on Friday and higher gas values
early in the day, peak power prices strengthened across the Eastern
Interconnect on Thursday.  ""The front-month picked up about a buck
everywhere, although it came off a little later, but that was the real news
today,"" commented one SERC player.  NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures were
up early, but fell in late trade.  February eased 2.8 cents to end at
2.048$/mmBtu, while March lost 0.1 cent to close at 2.09$/mmBtu.

Heavy load electricity prices climbed higher in the Mid-Atlantic on
Thursday, on cooler forecasts for Friday.  Western PJM pieces were bought
and sold between 21.85 and 22.75$/MWh.  LMPs spent most of the morning well
above 20$/MWh, but were weaker for most of the afternoon, averaging
21.2$/MWh through 15:00 EST.  Daytime highs for Friday were expected in the
cooler, although still above normal, mid-40s.  However, forecasts through
Monday called for temperatures to continue at least 11 degrees above normal
in the PJM region, and the latest six-to-ten called for above-normal
temperatures from January 30 to February 3.

With the mercury expected to drop throughout the Ohio Valley on Friday and
rumors of a unit shut late Wednesday, heavy load energy costs edged higher
in the Midwest on Thursday.  Into Cinergy day-ahead goods changed hands
between 17.5 and 18.5$/WMh.  ""Cinergy opened low, but today it climbed
instead of the slow fade we've seen the last few days.  Prices went above
$18 around 8 am, bounced up and down a bit, but stayed up there,"" said one
relieved trader.  The February contract was heard trading between 19.7 and
20.25$/MWh, also stronger than a day ago.  According to sources, a Wisconsin
Electric unit shut late Wednesday, but information on which unit, the cause,
or ETR were not available.  Daytime highs for Friday were only expected to
reach the mid-40s, with corresponding overnight lows expected to drop into
the upper-20s.  The cold snap was anticipated to be short-lived, with
weekend and Monday forecasts putting high temperatures right back into the
upper-50s.  The most current six-to-ten predicted mostly above-normal
temperatures, with a normal front moving in from the west, from January 30
to February 3.

With continued bearish fundamentals, peak power prices rose incrementally in
the Southeast and Texas on Thursday.  Into Entergy day-ahead deals were done
from 17 t0 17.7$/MWh, while February traded around 19 to 19.1$/MWh for most
of the day, dropping off a little later to 18.9$/MWh.  Into TVA trades
followed a similar pattern, with peak power for Friday delivery averaging
17$/MWh.  SERC forecasts called for highs to fall into the upper-50s on
Friday, before rebounding into the mid-60s for the weekend and upper-60s for
Monday.  Texas temperatures were expected to linger close to normal through
Saturday, before rising into the mid-70s by Monday.  The up to the minute
six-to-ten predicted above-normal temperatures from January 30 to February
3.

Today we announced the appointment of Jeff McMahon as Enron's chief financial officer.  In my continued discussions with the financial community yesterday and today, it became clear that this move was required to restore investor confidence.  Jeff has unparalleled qualifications and a deep and thorough understanding of Enron.  He is already on the job and hard at work on the issues before us.  Andy Fastow will be on a leave of absence from the company.  

Jeff had been serving as chairman and CEO of Enron Industrial Markets. He joined Enron in 1994 and spent three years in the London office as chief financial officer for Enron's European operations.  Upon returning to the U.S., Jeff was executive vice president of finance and treasurer for Enron Corp.  In 2000, he was named president and chief operating officer of Enron Net Works.

I know all of you are concerned about the continuing decline in our share price.  I am too, and we are working very hard to turn it around.  Appointing Jeff as CFO is one important step in that process.  But most of the solution involves just continuing to do our jobs with excellence.  The fundamentals of our business are strong, and I think the market will begin to see that as we continue to perform.

Please join me in giving Jeff your full support, and thank you for all of your continued hard work."

Duncan Demands Immunity

Day-ahead peak power prices in the Western U.S. were mostly steady for
Thursday delivery amid weather forecasts calling for a slight increase in
temperatures and an abundance of Northwest hydropower.  However,
temperatures were expected to drop again beginning on Friday, which offered
sellers a glimmer of hope for a stronger end to the month.  Additionally,
the latest six-to-ten from the National Weather Service showed the Western
U.S. blanketed in below-normal temperatures from January 29 through February
2.  NYMEX Henry Hub gas futures were mixed in moderate trade Wednesday, with
the fronts pushed down to new lows by mostly mild U.S. weather forecasts,
and again later in the session by a bearish AGA weekly inventory report.
February Hub gas fell 3 cents to close at 2.076$/mmBtu after reaching a new
contract low of 2.04$/mmBtu shortly after the AGA report was released.
March also hit a new low of 2.06$/mmBtu, but settled 2.9 cents lower than a
day ago at 2.089$/mmBtu.  The AGA inventory report indicated that 124 bcf
were taken out of storage last week, below industry estimates and the
five-year average drop of 182 bcf.  Total U.S. inventories stood at 2.405
tcf, 1.036 tcf, or 76% above last year.  Of the 124 bcf withdrawn, 21 were
taken out of the Western Consuming Region.  Total Western inventories stood
at 379 bcf, or 75 percent full.  Inventories for the same week a year ago
were 241 bcf, and have averaged 280 bcf over the past five years.  Now for
your daily dose of Enron.  David Duncan, the fired Andersen partner who was
the lead auditor for Enron Corp, challenged Congress by stating via his
attorney that he would invoke his Fifth Amendment rights and refuse to
testify at a hearing scheduled for Thursday unless he was granted immunity.
Committee chairman Rep. Billy Tauzin said that no immunity would be granted
Duncan without consent of the Justice Department.  ""I will not provide
immunity to anyone without consent of the Justice Department who is doing a
criminal investigation.  I have not received such a green light to this
date, as to whether or not they change their mind I can't say,"" said Tauzin
on CNN.

Heavy load energy costs in the Northwest were unchanged Wednesday as
abundant hydro supplies satiated regional heating demand.  ""It's still cold,
but we've got plenty of hydro to cushion us,"" said one Northwest utility
trader.  Flow forecasts for Chief Joseph were revised higher Wednesday,
coming in at 110 kcfs Thursday, 100 kcfs Friday, 75 kcfs Saturday, 65 kcfs
Sunday, 105 kcfs Monday, and 100 kcfs next Tuesday and Wednesday.  There was
no major unit news to report, but Colstrip #3 (700 MW) remained down for
generator repairs.  According to Weather Derivatives, heating demand in the
region was forecast to average 136% of normal through January 30, with the
greatest demand expected early next week.

Amid a healthy grid and concerns that weather could be slightly warmer than
expected later in the week, electricity prices were mostly steady in the
Golden State on Wednesday.  ""We're chasing gas and watching the extended
forecast pretty closely, but otherwise it is a boring day,"" said one Western
marketer. The heavy load product at SP15 changed hands between 22.55 and
24.4$/MWh, with the bulk of deals done around 23.25$/MWh, while light load
pieces were bought and sold from 16.5 to 18.85$/MWh.  In political news, the
CPUC approved two measures necessary for SCE's return to solvency.  SCE will
be allowed to raise $1.5 billion in bridge financing, which when combined
with $4 billion cash on hand, will permit the bankrupt utility to pay off
its creditors by the end of the first quarter.  Secondly, SCE will raise
consumer rates to cover the bridge financing.  ""SCE needs to pay off their
qualifying facilities, but it will be interesting to see whether they are
actually willing and able to pay the CalPX for power purchased on the
exchange, and for power purchased on their behalf by CAISO last winter.  I'm
a little skeptical, but I hope they do,"" commented one market analyst.  In
unit news, gas-fired Scattergood #3 (445 MW) was off the grid on Wednesday
for planned maintenance.  Highs for Thursday were predicted in the mid-60s
in Los Angeles, and low-50s at mid-state load centers.  Temperatures were
expected to remain below normal in California through Sunday.  The most
current six-to-ten called for below-normal temperatures from January 29 to
February 2.

On forecasts calling for slight warming, peak power prices in the Southwest
traded slightly lower for Thursday delivery.  ""Our overnight lows are
supposed to climb back into the 40s beginning tonight, and that's much more
tolerable than the 30s,"" said one Phoenix-based trader.  Heavy load energy
at Palo Verde traded anywhere from 19 to 23$/MWh, though most deals went
through around the 22$/MWh mark.  There was no significant unit news to
report on Wednesday, but there was some talk of an upcoming maintenance
outage.  Sources indicated that Navajo #2 (750 MW) was coming down for
planned maintenance on February 2, and returning on February 25.

___________________________________________________________
Hope of an upswing in the spot electricity market was firmly squashed
Wednesday as a bearish AGA report, incredibly warm January temperatures, and
soft gas values plagued the market, sending day-ahead power prices mostly
lower across the Eastern Interconnect.  Temperatures were expected anywhere
from 11 to 20 degrees above normal in the East on Thursday.  The AGA weekly
inventory report listed a total draw of 124 bcf, a number well below
industry estimates of around 145 bcf.  NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures,
already low, sunk further on the disappointing news coupled with the warm
weather pattern.  February shed 3 cents to close at 2.076$/mmBtu, while the
March contract fell 2.9 cents to end at 2.089$/mmBtu.  Both months reached
new contract lows during the day, before rebounding somewhat prior to the
close.

Heavy load energy costs slipped lower in the Mid-Atlantic on Wednesday.
""The dailies were pretty lame today, with the extremely mild temperatures
and the soft real-time prices.  Prices were a little erratic early, on a
possible unit outage, but demand is too weak for even a large curtailment to
matter,"" summed up one PJM trader.  Market players remained uncertain as to
which unit shut Wednesday.  Western PJM goods for Thursday delivery traded
between 21.5 and 21.9$/MWh, while the February contract lost about 15 cents,
trading mostly around 23.5$/MWh.  LMPs remained low on Wednesday, after
showing a little strength around 10:00 EST, and averaging 20.68$/MWh through
15:00 EST.  Daytime highs were expected to hit 62 degrees in D.C. on
Thursday, while other PJM load centers also expected warm temperatures, with
highs in the mid-50s.  The most current six-to-ten projected no relief in
sight, as above-normal temperatures were forecast from January 29 to
February 2.

Amid mild weather conditions and little else, peak electricity prices shed
value in the Midwest on Wednesday.  Into Cinergy goods opened at the day's
highest levels, and fell off steadily through the session, trading between
15.5 and 17.9$/MWh.  According to traders, February was actively traded,
bouncing between 19.4 and 19.55$/MWh.  Temperatures were expected to reach
highs in the low-50s on Thursday across ECAR.  The latest six-to-ten called
for above-normal temperatures from January 29 to February 2.

Day-ahead power prices tanked in the Southeast on Wednesday, weighed down by
bearish fundamentals.  Into Entergy deals were done between 17.1 and
18$/MWh, with the bulk of transactions heard near 17.75$/MWh.  February saw
action from 18.3 to 18.4$/MWh.  High temperatures across SERC were expected
in the spring-like upper-60s to low-70s on Thursday.  Texas power prices
bucked the trend on Wednesday, rising on cooler weather for Thursday.  The
most current six-to-ten called for above-normal temperatures in the
Southeast from January 29 to February 2.

O Drives:
1. For the old O or M drives go to O:\ESTATE\ O (or M ? pending location of data) and copy to the new common O.  The Estate O and M will be removed from UBS employees on Thursday night.

Do not delete anything and only copy information which is complies with the policy.  Please make sure that those people who are not in the office are contacted and comply.

How is everything?
 
I know That you tried getting back to me a couple of weeks ago after I sent you the earlier email, and we just keep missing each other!
 
Things move fast over here, the race season is going OK and I've managed not to kill myself yet! We have had an offer of some sponsorship in the states to race in the Speedvision Touring Car championship, so far we've got about 30% of the $600,000 that we need. I am trying to get hold of the names of some companies in th US who sell to end users (Joe Public) and perhaps are not normally associated with racing, big retailers, that sort of thing. I was wondering if you had any idea's, all I need is about six or seven company names, I can research the rest over the internet and send them some proposals via email. If you have two minutes to email them to me that would be great.
 
Cheers
 
John

Hi Mike,
 
Well, I did it, got the deal to do BTCC Touring Cars, it has a similar profile here in the UK to Nascar, but is actually very closely related to The Speedvision Touring Car Championship in the US.
 
Here's me and my team-mate racing;
 
We are having a very good year, but would like to do it in the US in 2002, can you give me a call on either 01625 520997 or my cell phone which is 07710 769289, I'd like to pick your brains on a couple of things. Can you believe people actually line up to get my autograph!!!! how weird is that?! Hope the family are well and look forward to talking to you soon.
 
John B&Q (it's a long story...but I changed my name AGAIN to match the sponsors name, so that when the commentary team on the TV talk about me....they advertise the sponsors brand!) "

Hope everything is going as well as could be expected.  First, I wanted to
ask you for a favor in that we are basically short to you 175 mw of cal 02
cob light and and 100 mw of 03 cob light.  Cob is such a thin market and I
was hoping you might be able to help us out on counterparties who might have
offsetting positions I could bookout with.  Second, we are going to be
looking to expand at the beginnning of 02, our credit is good with just
about everyone now, and we will be looking to hire one or two experienced
people to trade the west, especially one long term guy.  We're obviously not
as big as some shops but we have a very aggressive bonus payout.  Anyway,
something to keep in mind once things get more settled up there for you
guys.  Thanks to you and Bob for the help yesterday booking some of this
stuff out.

Hungry for Heat

Heavy load energy costs in the West received a boost on Monday, compliments
of forecasts calling for below-normal temperatures, increased generation
curtailments, and slightly higher natural gas prices.  The long-awaited
colder weather was likely to strengthen spot electricity prices over the
coming days, but opinions varied as to the extent and duration of the
forecasted cooling.  ""The cold is finally coming here, and temperatures
should remain below normal for at least a week,"" said one Northwest trader,
who added, ""I'm sure the dailies will react to this bullish weather pattern,
but there's so much gas in storage and water in the rivers that prices may
not rise as much as some people are anticipating.""  NYMEX Henry Hub futures
contracts rose Monday amid reported short covering, but the gains were said
to be limited by moderate weather forecasts for the eastern U.S., and
continued concerns surrounding high gas storage levels.  February Hub gas
rose 4.6 cents to close at 2.25$/mmBtu, while March gained 3.7 cents to
settle at 2.24$/mmBtu.  In other industry news, attorneys for bankrupt Enron
Corp. said Monday they were delaying the release of details about Enron's
trading unit sale to the Swiss financial institution UBS Warburg until 23:00
EST Monday.  Enron and its attorneys would not comment on the reason for the
delay.  Patience is a virtue?isn't it?

Peak power prices in the Northwest were on the rise for Tuesday delivery, a
trend many players believed would continue through much of the week.  A
round of colder weather was expected to increase heating demand in the
region over the next several days.  According to Weather Derivatives,
heating demand in the region was expected to average 110 percent of normal
through January 21, while the most recent six-to-ten-day forecast from the
National Weather Service was predicting that below-normal temperatures would
continue blanketing the Northwest through January 24.  Healthy flows at
regional hydro generating units, however, had some parties convinced that
the cold would come and go without incident, and that the upside for daily
prices would therefore be limited.  Flows for Chief Joseph on the Columbia
River came in at 95 kcfs through Thursday, 90 kcfs Friday, 60 kcfs Saturday,
50 kcfs Sunday, and 100 kcfs next Monday.  In unit news, Bridger #3 (520 MW)
was reportedly still off line Monday for tube leak repairs, though sources
were expecting the Wyoming-based unit to return later Monday evening.
Wyoming-based Naughton #3 (330 MW) came down Sunday for tube leak repairs
expected to last from 48 to 72 hours.

With temperatures slated to remain near to slightly above normal through
Friday, day-ahead peak power in the Golden State firmed up for Tuesday
delivery.  Marketers cited an increase in off-line generation as the primary
factor in the price increase.  Peak goods at SP-15 were the premium fare on
Monday, with pieces changing hands between 23 and 26.25$/MWh.  The latest
six-to-ten called for temperatures to hover around normal from January 20 to
24. In the news, the California Chamber of Commerce and the California
Business Roundtable proposed eliminating the Consumer Power and Conservation
Financing Authority and the Electricity Oversight Board, and to consolidate
the duties of the Public Utilities Commission, the Energy Commission, the
Department of Conservation, and the energy division of the California
Department of Water Resources.  Chamber of Commerce President Allan
Zaremberg cited the many overlapping duties of these government entities as
creating competition and conflicts of interest, with the end result of
inflating the state's electricity costs, while two of the entities are of
dubious worth anyhow.  The newly-formed Consumer Power and Conservation
Financing Authority has not done anything besides drain state resources
since its inception in August, and the Electricity Oversight Board has
shrunk to a single board member in the absence of its primary duty - to
oversee the now-defunct California Power Exchange.  Legislators vowed to
untangle the web of conflict, redundancy, and inefficiency carefully, to
avoid causing an even bigger mess than the one they aim to repair.
Generation had a turbulent weekend, with small-unit outages climbing by
almost 1,700 MW since Friday, and Encina #4 (303 MW) joining sister unit
Encina #5 (332 MW) in off-line status.

As temperatures in the Southwest were poised to dip through the week, spot
electricity prices reacted in kind, gaining as much as 4$/MWh for Tuesday
delivery.  Slightly higher natural gas prices were also said to be adding
strength to the dailies.  Peak power at Palo Verde ranged from 22 to
26$/MWh, with the bulk of transactions seen between 23.75 and 24$/MWh.
Weather Derivatives projected that heating demand in the desert region would
average 112 percent of normal through January 21, peaking out at 123 percent
of normal on January 18.  The latest six-to-ten from the NWS was also
calling for below-normal temperatures across the Southwest through January
24.  ""Our daytime highs are expected to fall into the mid 60s, and our
overnight lows into the mid 40s.  I know that doesn't sound all that cold,
but thin-blooded Southwesterners will undoubtedly be turning on the heat,""
said one Phoenix-based trader.  In unit news, Coronado #1 (365 MW) ramped up
to two thirds capacity over the weekend, and was scheduled to hit full power
sometime on Tuesday.

___________________________________________________________
Day-ahead peak power turned in mixed results on Monday across the Eastern
Interconnect, with northern hubs showing slight price decreases and southern
hubs strengthening in the face of covert unit outages.  In the north,
temperatures as much as 15 degrees above normal sucked the life out of the
market, while southern hubs, despite above-normal temperatures, surged
upward amid what some marketers assumed were unreported unit outages.  NYMEX
gas futures gained some ground Monday on short covering, but mild weather
and massive inventory levels limited the upside. The February Henry Hub
contract gained 4.6 cents to close at 2.25$/mmBtu, while March rose 3.7
cents to settle at 2.24$/mmBtu.

Peak power prices for Tuesday delivery at Western PJM changed hands from 22
to 23.65$/MWh, losing ground from Friday's 24.55 to 25.1$/MWh trades.
Marketers blamed forecasts calling for temperatures as high as 12 degrees
above normal at least through Friday, with rain showers likely Monday and
Tuesday. The latest six-to-ten likewise forecasted temperatures to remain
firmly entrenched in above-normal territory from January 20 through 24. Many
described Monday's market environment as a ""state of confusion, with a lack
of clear direction and thin, illiquid trading"" among players.  Just before
06:30 on Monday, LMPs spiked to 46$/MWh, and rose again right before 07:00
to just under 40$/MWh, but during peak hours prices did not reach more than
about 32$/MWh.  The average for LMPs on Monday was 22.51$/MWh through 14:00.
In unit news, nuclear unit Salem (1105 MW) was reportedly off-line Monday
for undisclosed reasons, with an ETR of Tuesday, January 15.

Into Cinergy day-ahead prices were mostly flat to Friday's peak power
prices, with goods for Tuesday delivery changing hands from 16 to 18.5$/MWh.
This represented a loss of 50 cents on the low end and a gain of 35 cents on
the high.  Temperatures remained unseasonably warm on Monday, with the
five-day forecast calling for temperatures to swing from up to 8 degrees
above normal on Tuesday to 3 degrees below normal on Thursday.  ""There's
still hope that the week could see some strength,"" dreamed one player in
reference to the favorable forecast.  The latest six-to-ten called for a
return to normalcy from January 20 through 24.  There were no new unit
outages to report in ECAR on Monday, but it was reported that Palisades #1
(789 MW) could join the grid again as soon as January 18.

The blast of cold air that brushed across the Midwest last week was
breathing its last icy breaths in the Southeast on Monday, with temperatures
predicted to pick up and remain above normal through Friday.  Into Entergy
goods traded at a 0.6 to 3.5$/MWh premium from Friday's trades, with peak
power for Tuesday delivery changing hands from 18 to 22.5$/MWh.  Some
marketers insisted that weather had nothing to do with it.  ""Obviously,
there are some units off, or prices wouldn't have come up like they did,""
commented one contented seller, ""it's just that nobody's going to know which
ones for a couple of days.""  The latest six-to-ten predicted Southeastern
temperatures would remain firmly above normal from January 20 to 24.  Peak
power prices for Tuesday delivery at Into TVA also gained ground from prices
seen on Friday, with pieces changing hands from 18.25 to 21.5$/MWh on
Monday.  ""Prices started out at the low end, but I think some buyers got
caught, and didn't mind paying a little more to cover themselves, so prices
came up over the session,"" ventured one savvy trader.  There were no new
unit outages or curtailments to report in the SERC region on Monday, despite
assertions by various players that some units must be out.

Four Days Before Christmas

'Twas 4 days before Christmas, and all thru the West
Few traders were working, 10 percent at best;
Marketers had tallied their books up with care,
In hopes that year-end bonuses soon would be there.

Enron was nestled down deep in the red,
Battling lawsuits from many, and claims by the Fed;
With Osama on the run, and Jeff Skilling in Brazil,
There are not many wishes left to fulfill.

Stockings were hung by the boilers with care,
But lumps of coal showed that Enron passed there;
All rejoice and thanks to Ken Lay,
Even Santa frets 'bout his 401k.

With hydro abundant, and gas storage so high,
It looked as though the West would not bat an eye;
The shorts in the market sang a chorus of cheer,
""Prices are a shadow of what they were last year.""

Another calendar gone by, and what a doozy it was,
So close up your shops, catch a well-deserved buzz;
A sincere wish for all, we hope you made a buck,
Happy Holidays to all, and to all Good Luck!


But seriously folks?Western peak power prices for the Christmas
Day/Wednesday package were mostly flat to levels seen for the Sunday/Monday
combo.  ""It's supposed to get a little bit colder out there over the long
weekend, but the combination of weak holiday demand and abundant hydro
generation has given traders little cause for concern,"" explained one
marketer.  Spot gas prices on most Western pipelines were flat to slightly
higher than levels seen on the previous day, while NYMEX Henry Hub futures
contracts rose sharply on some colder forecasts for the eastern U.S. and a
flurry of short covering ahead of the long weekend.  January Hub gas rose an
impressive 20.9 cents to close at 2.895$/mmBtu, while February gained 18.1
cents to settle at 2.889$/mmBtu.  With end-of-the-year loads firmly in
place, most players expected little in the way of price movement over the
next week.

Electricity prices in the Northwest were virtually unchanged for the
Tuesday/Wednesday package, compliments of steady holiday loads and abundant
regional hydropower.  Peak power at the Mid-Columbia changed hands from
19.25 to 21$/MWh, with the bulk of trades taking place between 19.5 and
20.5$/MWh.  Flow forecasts for Chief Joseph were off slightly from the
previous day, likely in anticipation of waning holiday demand.  Flows were
predicted to be 75 kcfs Saturday, 55 kcfs Sunday, 70 kcfs Christmas Eve, 50
kcfs Christmas Day, and 85 kcfs Wednesday through Friday.  The latest
six-to-ten from the NWS was calling for mostly normal temperatures through
the end of the month.

Peak power prices in California for Wednesday delivery ended slightly weaker
than the Sunday-Monday package.  In the news, a report by the Bureau of
State Audits, released Thursday, criticized the California Department of
Water Resources for a lack of analysis of power demand in the state before
it signed 57 contracts for long-term power with energy companies.  The
urgency generated by pressure from the Davis administration to sign
long-term agreements precluded the planning necessary for projects of such
large-scale, according to the report, and resulted in the omission of
important details which would have better shielded California in the event
of failure by the supplier to deliver the power, or in times of excess
demand.  The contracts were negotiated in a matter of weeks rather than the
usual months, and tied Californians into paying more than double the current
spot prices for electricity for the next decade.  Oscar Hidalgo, spokesman
for the team of buyers at the DWR, defended the DWR's performance, saying
""The lights are on; the costs are way down; stability is back in the market.
The long-term contracts are a big part of it.""  However, the Bureau's report
noted that the state likely bought too much electricity, and as a result
will have to sell much of its power during times of low demand at a loss on
the spot market.  This alone could cost consumers as much as $4 billion over
the next decade.  At the same time, the contracts do not include many
commitments from ""peaker"" (intermittent load-contingent) plants, which would
make the state once again vulnerable to price spikes at times of peak
demand.  In unit news, gas-fired Contra Costa #7 (337 MW) slipped back onto
the grid after a one-day maintenance outage.  Encina #5 (332 MW) also began
ramping up on Friday, and was at 250 MW by 11:15 PST.  Temperatures were
slightly below normal but above freezing, and expected to remain that way
through Christmas.  The latest six-to-ten called for some cooling from
December 27 to 31.

Peak prices in the Southwest were little changed for the Tuesday/Wednesday
package, while light load goods fell modestly, by less than 1$/MWh in most
cases.  ""We anticipate little change in prices or demand through January 1,""
said one Southwest utility trader.  In unit news, Mohave #1 (790 MW)
remained off-line Friday with no ETR available.  The unit was reportedly
suffering from exciter problems, but details were vague.  Weather forecasts
called for temperatures to dip to slightly below normal over the weekend in
Phoenix, while the latest six-to-ten from the NWS was predicting
below-normal temperatures for the entire desert region for the last week in
December.

Faced with apathetic holiday demand, prices across the Eastern Interconnect
plummeted for Monday delivery.  ""Without schools, businesses, or even myself
in operation on Monday, almost nothing moved today,"" admitted one trader of
his intention to avoid the energy market on Christmas Eve.  Most traders
were putting together their Wednesday packages on Friday, in order to extend
their weekends through the Christmas holiday.  ""Wednesday prices showed
strength over Friday packages, presumably on the uncertainty of trading so
far out and forecasts calling for cooler weather over the next week,"" opined
one PJM player.  NYMEX Henry Hub forward contracts showed renewed vigor on
colder late-month forecasts and heavy short covering.  The January contract
gained 20.9 cents to close at 2.895$/mmBtu, while the February contract rose
18.1 cents to end the day at 2.889$/mmBtu.

Not even the Mid-Atlantic bucked the trend on Friday.  Marketers were
restless and eager to either cover their meager loads or divest themselves
of their excess energy and then head home for the holidays.  There was not a
lot of volatility in the LMPs, which briefly spiked to 56.4$/MWh just after
07:00 EST, but swiftly fell into the near-average groove of 21.61$/MWh
through 15:00 EST.  Monday prices hovered in a narrow range between 21 and
21.5$/MWh, while Wednesday pieces went at a premium even to Friday goods,
trading from 24.5 to 25.25$/MWh.  Nary an outage was reported in all of PJM,
which some marketers cited as yet another reason for the lackadaisical
nature of Friday's energy market.  Temperatures were predicted by Weather
Services Corp. to warm into above-normal territory by Christmas Day, while
the latest six-to-ten called for temperatures from near to below-normal
between December 27 and 31.

Prices across the Midwest slid by 4 to 6$/MWh for Monday delivery during
Friday's trading.  Most marketers reported making only one or two trades, as
above-normal temperatures precluded healthy heating demand and the almost
universal closures of businesses and schools ""took the spirit out of the
market,"" as one trader put it.  Monday Into Cinergy goods changed hands
between 14 and 18$/MWh, while Wednesday pieces sold for anywhere from 22 to
25$/MWh, a premium to prices seen for Friday.  ""There's some uncertainty
involved with trading five days out, and besides, it's supposed to get
colder,"" remarked one ECAR player.  No new unit outages were reported in
ECAR, though Palisades #1 (789 MW) remained in cold shutdown, as it has been
since the end of June 2001.  Temperatures lingered between the mid 20s and
the high 30s on Friday, but were expected to warm into the high 40s by the
end of the weekend, further shaving off heating demand for Monday.  The
latest six-to-ten predicted temperatures to be near to below normal from
December 27 to 31.

SERC traders were scrambling to move what they could before everyone else
stampeded from their offices for the Christmas holiday, and few had any
trades to report.  ""With the Enron debacle, I think most of us are sitting
out the action until the end of the year,"" remarked one TVA player.  Monday
Into TVA pieces took a nosedive on Friday, trading between 15.75 and
17.5$/MWh - and the high end was almost an anomaly, according to the price
data of many marketers.  Into Entergy likewise tanked, moving for anywhere
from 17 to 21$/MWh.  Wednesday showed more strength, with Into TVA trading
at a slight premium to Friday's goods, from 22 to 22.5$/MWh, and Into
Entergy pieces trading from 22 to 24$/MWh.  Temperatures were not expected
to ratchet up heating demand over the next five days, for despite
below-normal temperatures across much of the region, daytime highs were
predicted to reach the upper 50s.  The latest six-to-ten called for
temperatures to fall to below normal levels from December 27 to 31.

Crazy Caught in California

Peak power prices for Thursday delivery were mostly lower across the West
Wednesday on revised weather forecasts and lower spot gas prices.  On
Tuesday, some forecasts were calling for Arctic air to descend upon northern
areas of the WSCC in the coming days, but on Wednesday most forecasts were
toting less severe warnings.  ""A day ago they were saying we would get hit
by a blast of Arctic air, and now they are saying we will get some cooler
air, but not of the Arctic variety,"" said one Northwest utility trader.  The
revised forecasts also helped to lower balance-of-the-month contract costs
at all of the major Western hubs.  ""I was shocked that the dailies and the
balance traded lower today, we were expecting at least a little upside after
yesterday's session,"" said one surprised marketer.  NYMEX Henry Hub gas
contracts settled lower Wednesday despite a supportive AGA inventory report,
largely due to concerns surrounding high storage levels.  February and March
Hub gas contracts fell 5.3 cents each to settle at 2.228 and 2.232$/mmBtu,
respectively.  Wednesday's AGA report indicated that 190 bcf were pulled out
of storage last week, well above industry estimates calling for a 175-bcf
draw.  Total U.S. inventories stand at 2.666 tcf, 1.014 tcf, or 71 percent
of full.  Of the 190-bcf drawn last week only seven were taken from the
Western Consuming Region.  Total Western stocks stand at 407 bcf, or 81
percent of full.  Western stocks were at 277 bcf on the same week last year,
and have averaged 313 bcf over the past five years.  In news of the weird, a
recently fired employee of California nuclear power plant San Onofre (2,150
MW total) was arrested on Wednesday for making death threats against his
former boss and coworkers.  Law enforcement investigators found over 200
guns, rifles, and munitions in his home and more when they searched a nearby
storage locker.  Two officers were briefly hospitalized after inhaling an
unknown yellow gas released from a canister in the storage locker.
Officials said the arrest was not terrorist-related, and with the suspect in
custody no further threat was posed to the power plant.

Heavy load energy costs in the Northwest were steady to slightly higher on
Wednesday, to the surprise of many.  On Tuesday, regional forecasts were
revised to reflect the anticipated arrival of Arctic air, which pushed the
dailies higher.  Wednesday brought about another forecast revision, this
time in the opposite direction.  While longer-term forecasts continued to
call for below-normal temperatures for much of the region, the extent of the
cooling was not expected to be as severe as previously anticipated.  Flow
forecasts for Chief Joseph were revised slightly lower on Wednesday, coming
in at 75 kcfs through Friday, 65 kcfs Saturday, 55 kcfs Sunday, 90 kcfs
Monday, and 85 kcfs next Tuesday and Wednesday.  The lower flows partly
reflected the return of cooler temperatures, which have curtailed recent
snowmelt, reducing side flows in turn.  On the topic of water, the Northwest
River Forecast Center slightly lowered its runoff forecast for this year at
some of the region's large Columbia River Dams.  Nonetheless, it appeared
likely that the Northwest would still have much healthier water levels in
2002 compared to last year's ""drought-like"" conditions.  April through
September supplies at Grand Coulee were forecast to be 94 percent of normal,
while The Dalles was expected to be about 93 percent of normal for the same
period.  In unit news, Colstrip #4 (700 MW) tripped late Tuesday or early
Wednesday due to a suspected tube leak, and was reportedly given a 48-hour
turnaround time.

Day-ahead electricity prices were mostly lower in California on Wednesday
amid warmer weather for much of the state.  NP15 and SP15 traded almost flat
to each other, while COB traded about two dollars lower.  Balance of January
at NP15 slipped with the rest of the West on Wednesday, trading between 20.5
and 22.5$/MWh and losing its premium over the day-ahead prices.  In
political news, the CPUC said they wanted more input in the PG&E
reorganization proposal.  Specifically, the commission thinks parent PG&E
Corp. should be required to invest a more substantial stake in the repayment
process.  The FERC judge who originally ruled in favor of El Paso Corp.
officially reopened the anti-competitive case against the energy firm,
saying new evidence could make him change his recommendation.  The company
was accused of withholding transmission on its natural gas pipelines into
California during last year's energy crisis.  In unit news, Moss Landing #6
(739 MW) was operating at 300 MW on Wednesday for planned reasons.  There
was talk that one of the two Intermountain units (820 each) was coming off
this weekend for annual maintenance, while other sources said it wasn't
exiting the grid until early February, but no official word was available as
of this writing.  Above-normal temperatures were expected to continue on
Thursday, with forecasts calling for highs in the mid-50s to mid-60s at
mid-state load centers, and in the low-70s in the south.  Highs in the Bay
area were expected to drop about ten degrees on Friday, but otherwise little
change was expected in the Golden State through Sunday.  The most current
six-to-ten predicted below-normal temperatures from January 15 to 19.

It was a buyers market in the Southwest on Wednesday, with several players
reporting that sellers were coming out of the woodwork.  ""We tried to sell
early, but everyone told us to call back if we needed any power.  Later on
we did call some people back because prices fell below the marginal costs of
some of our less-efficient units,"" said one Arizona-based trader.  Daytime
highs in Phoenix hit 81 degrees on Tuesday, while overnight lows were
hovering mainly in the 50s.  Utilities were still seeing loads pick up in
the late evening and early morning hours, but the patterns were said to be
more reminiscent of spring than winter.  In unit news, Four Corners #5 (750
MW) was still operating at 550 MW on Wednesday due to an air preheater
problem.  The New-Mexico based unit was scheduled to come down for annual
maintenance on January 15, and not return until March 14.  Weather forecasts
called for above-normal temperatures though the week in the region's major
load centers, while the latest six-to-ten from the NWS was prediction normal
temperatures from January 15 through 19.

___________________________________________________________
Amid above-normal temperatures, the expectation of further warming on
Thursday, and softer natural gas prices, heavy load electricity prices
slipped across the Eastern Interconnect on Wednesday.  ""The weather outlook
is bearish right now, and gas dropped about 8 or 9 cents pretty much across
the board, so February fell off and the dailies took a hit as well,"" said
one Midwestern trader.  The AGA storage report listed a bullish withdrawal
of 190 bcf, mostly from the Eastern Consuming Region.  Despite the
supportive AGA, NYMEX Henry Hub natural gas futures fell on Wednesday.
February lost 5.3 cents to close at 2.228$/mmBtu, while March also fell 5.3
cents to end at 2.232$/mmBtu.

Forecasts for warming temperatures were the main culprits bringing PJM
day-ahead power prices lower on Wednesday, despite strong real-time prices
for much of the morning and a key coal unit outage.  Pennsylvania-based
Homer City #1 (620 MW) reportedly came off-line late Tuesday with a header
crack, and was expected to remain down until February 6.  Sources also said
coal-fired Conemaugh #2 (850 MW) was out of service on Wednesday, although
no official confirmation was available.  Western PJM goods changed hands
between 22.5 and 23.6$/MWh, down over a dollar to a day ago.  February was
heard trading between 25 and 25.5$/MWh, down at least fifty cents, mostly on
weaker gas and warmer weather. LMPs averaged 32.4$/MWh through 14:00 EST,
after plateauing above 70$/MWh for almost an hour starting at 09:40 EST.
Temperatures were expected to reach highs in the 50s on Thursday, with lows
in the 38 to 41 degree range.  The latest six-to-ten from the NWS called for
normal temperatures from January 15 to 19.

Peak power prices weakened in the Midwest again on Wednesday, dragged down
by the same factors affecting the rest of the Eastern electricity market;
namely warmer weather and weaker gas.  Into Cinergy pieces for Thursday
delivery slipped about a buck, trading between 18.4 and 20.5$/MWh.  ""Dailies
were low for most of the day, but cracked into the 20s late, which is a
typical trading pattern,"" remarked one Cinergy player.  February also edged
down about 75 cents, with deals heard between 21.5 and 21.75$/MWh.  Weather
conditions were predicted to be mild on Thursday, with high temperatures in
the mid-40s and lows in the upper-30s.  The most current six-to-ten called
for normal temperatures from January 15 to 19.

Warm weather, weak demand, and soft gas placed downward pressure on the
Southeastern electricity market Wednesday, but the Entergy dailies ended
higher anyway, with some shorts bidding prices up late.  Into Entergy goods
were bought and sold between 18.75 and 23$/MWh, while Into TVA deals were
done from 19.25 to 20.25$/MWh.  In political news, the PJM Interconnection
applied to become the operator of the proposed SeTrans RTO in the
Southeastern U.S. on Wednesday.  High temperatures were expected to rise
into the low-60s on Thursday, before dropping back into the 50s for the rest
of the week.  The most current six-to-ten predicted normal temperatures from
January 15 to 19.

The NWS winter outlook is finalized. I have provided a link. The NWS is basically bullish in the East and Southern Canada for cold weather while mild to bearish in most of the West temperature-wise. The precipitation forecast for the Pac NW Hydro Basins is regarded as ""near normal"" or 95-105%. 

Note - this is the first time in 10 winter seasons that the NWS is forecasting below normal temperatures from the Midwest into the Northwest for DEC to FEB. 

Also, the finalized versions of Earth Sat are in all of your drop boxes.

Enron ""Stock"" (Certificates) Soars

As power contracts moved into the New Year, marketers across the WSCC saw
prices firm up, if only marginally.  ""We're still looking at some pretty
mild weather forecasts, and precipitation and flows are still healthy,""
noted one Northwest player.  Enron once again graced the wire agencies on
Friday, as always garnering dubious honors.  Collectors can now buy Enron
stock certificates for up to $99 on eBay.  That is almost $9 more than the
actual stock sold for on its best day!  Evidently, Enron's historic demise
has placed its stock in the same Hall of Fame as stock certificates from
Czarist Russia and from now-nonexistent countries, and is a sought-after
commodity by collectors and enthusiasts.  Meanwhile, abundant natural gas
supplies have kept a lid on NYMEX Henry Hub futures prices.  The February
contract, trading for its first day in the front-month position, gained 15.5
cents over the day's trading, erasing half of Thursday's loss, to close at
2.774$/mmBtu.  March followed hot on February's heels, rising 11.6 cents to
settle at 2.746$/mmBtu.

Peak power costs in the Northwest showed some strength in the new month on
news of a large outage in the eastern reaches of the region, the five-day
uncertainty, and forecasts for colder weather in the near future.
Mid-Columbia peak goods traded from 23.5 to 27$/MWh, a gain of 3.75$/MWh on
the high end and .75$/MWh on the low.  Temperatures across the region ranged
from firmly below freezing to the low 50s on Friday, but the five-day
forecast called for colder weather on both sides of the Cascade Range
through January 1.  The latest six-to-ten predicted Northwest temperatures
to stick just below normal from January 3 to 7.  Forecasted flows at Chief
Joseph remained healthy, but were revised slightly downward to 75 kcfs
Saturday, 60 kcfs Sunday, 90 kcfs Monday, 55 kcfs Tuesday, 95 kcfs Wednesday
and Thursday, and 90 kcfs next Friday.  There was no news of unit outages in
the Pacific Northwest on Friday, but East of the Rockies, in Montana, news
that PPL Montana's Colstrip #4 (740 MW) had tripped off line late Thursday
washed over the WSCC market.  Both the cause and the ETR were kept close to
the chest.

Despite softer gas prices on key pipelines in the West, day-ahead
electricity prices strengthened in the Golden State on Friday, with the
inclusion of the first working day of 2002 in the two-day package boosting
load forecasts.  As two unit outages affected the SP15 grid, heavy load
prices climbed almost 4$/MWh, trading between 26.75 and 30.75$/MWh.  Light
load goods changed hands between 20.5 and 24.5$/MWh.  Spot gas at the
Southern California border settled 9 cents lower on Friday from 2.43 to
2.48$/mmBtu.  In hydro happenings, the DWR reported that data for last week
shows the California snow pack already standing at 55% of expected April 1
levels.  If the current precipitation trends continue the snow pack will be
at 120% of the average, a welcome sign for all those watching generation at
the northern hydros.  In unit news, gas-fired Ormond Beach #1 (725 MW) was
off-line on Friday for planned maintenance, while Alamitos #6 (480 MW) also
tripped, but for unplanned reasons.  The five-day forecast continued to show
little change, as temperatures were expected to remain within 5 degrees of
normal through Tuesday.  Los Angeles forecasts called for highs in the
mid-60s Monday and Tuesday, while mid-state load centers were expected to be
about 10 degrees cooler.  The most current six-to-ten predicted above-normal
temperatures from January 3 to 7.

With cold weather firmly entrenched across the Southwest and forecasts
calling for greater cooling and even snow, peak power at Palo Verde firmed
up about 3.25$/MWh on the high end for the first peak day of the New Year.
Peak goods traded from 26 to 29.25$/MWh on Friday, up from the 25 to 26$/MWh
seen on Thursday.  ""Sure it's kind of cold,"" admitted one seller, ""but
unless we get some big unit outages or a gas spike, we're not going to see
much strength in the market any time soon.""  There were no unit outages to
report in the Southwest on Friday.  Daytime highs in the north were on the
low side of freezing and expected to stay that way into next year, while
temperatures in the south ranged from the high 30s to mid-60s, and were
forecast to cool off as the New Year approaches.  The latest six-to-ten
called for below-normal temperatures to grip the region from January 3 to 7.

With light demand for New Year's Eve expected to lead into the middle of the
new week and colder temperatures on the horizon, peak power for Monday
delivery edged down across the Eastern Interconnect in lackluster end of the
week trading.  Wednesday goods gained ground as higher load forecasts pushed
early prices up.  ""We usually do 1500 MW of PJM dailies at least, but this
short week between the holidays we've been lucky to do 100 MW each day.
There just doesn't seem to be an active market out there,"" commented one
Mid-Atlantic trader, adding that he was heading home early, a sentiment
echoed by many in the East on Friday.  To the relief of many gas watchers,
NYMEX Henry Hub futures rebounded somewhat on Friday.  February climbed 15.5
cents to close at 2.774$/mmBtu, while March gained 11.6 cents to end at
2.746$/mmBtu.

Colder weather forecasts in the new week were balanced by light load
expectations ahead of the holiday, which sent heavy load electricity prices
down in the Mid-Atlantic on Friday.  ""Trading was choppy today.  I'd buy a
piece, and the offer would disappear before I could pick up another,""
commented one PJM dealer.  Western PJM goods for Monday delivery changed
hands between 23.75 and 24$/MWh, while early deals for Wednesday delivery
were heard between 24.5 and 27$/MWh.  Traders thought the market for
Wednesday would probably firm up on Monday.  ""Balance for next week looks
promising.  It's all that cold weather,"" said one market player.  The
Jan/Feb contract saw action between 30.1 and 30.5$/MWh on Friday.  After
jumping to 33$/MWh twice in the early afternoon, LMPs averaged 19.28$/MWh
through 15:00 EST.  Temperatures for the early part of the new week were
expected to be nice and cold, with overnight lows in the 20 to 23 degree
range.  The latest six-to-ten called for below-normal temperatures from
January 3 to 7.

Spot electricity prices traded down for another day in the Midwest on
Friday, despite an anticipated drop in the mercury for the new week.  Into
Cinergy deals for Monday were seen between 18 and 19.75$/MWh, losing another
buck off the low end and almost two off the high.  The Wednesday picture
looked a little better, trading between 21.75 and 25$/MWh.  Strangely the
winter contract also lost ground on Friday, with transactions heard as low
as 24.4$/MWh.  Cold weather was expected to settle over the Midwest with a
vengeance, with highs for Monday and Tuesday expected in the 17 to 25 degree
range and lows in the frigid single digits.  The most current six-to-ten
predicted below-normal temperatures from January 3 to 7.

Amid very slow trading and colder temperatures expected in the new week,
peak power prices were flat to lower in the Southeast on Friday.  Into
Entergy pieces for Monday delivery were bought and sold from 21.5 to
23$/MWh, with the bulk of deals heard around 21.5 to 22$/MWh.  Wednesday
deals were tentatively heard between 23.5 and 25$/MWh.  Into TVA
transactions for New Year's Eve went through from 18.5 to 19.25$/MWh, while
Wednesday saw action slightly higher from 19.9 to 20.1$/MWh.  Overnight lows
were expected in the mid-20s by Monday, with highs in the low-40s.  The
latest six-to-ten called for below-normal temperatures from January 3 to 7.

It can, however, lighten our burden as we help others.  

After much thought, we have decided to go forward with our Enron Elves Event. In partnership with the Salvation Army, we have adopted three underprivileged families. Enron Elves is an opportunity to provide gifts for children who would otherwise go without.   

The official Enron Elves Tree has been erected and will soon be adorned with holiday gift tags.  Each gift tag contains a gift idea for a child.  

If you would like to participate in Enron Elves, here's what you do:
?	Take a candy cane gift tag from the tree
?	Sign your name to one side of the folded gift tag and place the signed tag in the box by the tree 
?	The other gift tag needs to come back attached to the wrapped gift 
?	Bring the wrapped gift and place it under the tree

All gifts need to be wrapped and under the tree by December 18.  We will then hold a prize drawing, including Blazer Basketball tickets, for those employees who participated.  

Thank you for considering those in need during this holiday season.

Enron announced today that its common stock will now be traded as an Over-the-Counter (OTC) equity security under the symbol ""ENRNQ.""  This follows a decision by the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to file an application to delist Enron's common stock, which means that Enron's common stock and related securities are suspended from trading on the NYSE.  Enron is considering whether to appeal the NYSE's decision.

The NYSE has standard criteria for listing stocks, which can be found on their website at www.nyse.com.  Enron recently fell below the following listing criteria: average closing price of a security less than $1.00 over a consecutive 30 trading-day period.  Quotation service for Enron's stock will now be provided by the National Quotation Bureau, LLC ""Pink Sheets.""

Congratulations go out to the New England Patriots and the St. Louis Rams for earning a trip Super Bowl XXXVI (36). It should be a good game despite what the odds makers are saying, which is St. Louis to win by 14 points. New England keeps surprising and I expect them to make it a closer game than people think. 

I'm writing to tell you about the Super Bowl Square Pools on OFP. Square pools are the 10x10 grid pools that you often see for the Super Bowl. I always run a square pool on OFP during our Super Bowl party. I set up the pool and then people who are OFP members can log in and enter their own picks (even if they aren't at the party) and for everyone else, I create an Alias for them and enter their picks that way. It's super easy and it makes for a fun time and an exciting game, even if your team isn't winning. 

You can start your Square Pool now and see how it works and get things set up. Then if you like the format and want to proceed with the pool, Square Pools cost only $6.95, less than 7 cents per square. Start your square pool now! <http://www.officefootballpool.com/jumpto.cfm?id=155>

I also wanted to tell you about our NCAA Basketball Tournament Pool site called www.tournamentpools.com. I've been working hard to get Tournament Pools up and running for the 2002 season. There's a slick new javascript picksheet and other great improvements. If you liked Tournament Pools last year, you'll love it this year. Look for my announcement next week saying that Tournament Pools is open. 

I hope you have a great Super Bowl and if you don't run a Square Pool I hope to see you for basketball at TournamentPools.com. 

Good luck!

Peter Swartz Joins EPIS as Vice President of Development

 
West Linn, Oregon, January 16, 2002 - EPIS, Inc., developer of the AURORA? Electric Market Model, announced that Peter J. Swartz has joined EPIS as Vice President of Development, with responsibility for the development of market modeling software as well as forecasting products and services. 
 
Mr. Swartz, 51, previously was the senior model developer for Northwest Power Planning Council. The Power Planning Council is a four-state planning agency that oversees the regional energy and fish and wildlife interests in coordination with the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA). As the principal author of the Council's power system planning and decision analysis models, he spearheaded the application of these tools to issues concerning resource economics and reliability in the Northwest power system, including the treatment of planning under uncertainty. Mr. Swartz has pioneered analytical models to examine the tradeoffs between system operation policy and effects on fish and wildlife constraints. 
 
""EPIS has grown significantly over the last three years. Our success in large measure is to due to timely development of modeling capabilities, and we are committed to continuing to meet our clients' energy forecasting needs for 2002 and beyond,"" said Warren Winter, EPIS President. ""We are pleased that an individual with Peter Swartz's experience is joining our management team. Mr. Swartz has more than 20 years of experience in power system modeling and analysis and will be a great asset to our continued growth and success."" 
 
""Not only does he bring strong model development capabilities, he also brings a wealth of background in energy policy and extensive analysis on energy issues, including the bulk power markets,"" Winter said.
 
Mr. Swartz also has provided consulting services to the water industry, developing water supply planning models for use in the analysis of supply, transmission, and conservation alternatives. Prior to 1982, he spent three years at Portland General Electric (PGE) in financial and resource planning.  Also, has taught management science and statistics at the School of Business Oregon State University. 
 
Swartz earned a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering from Oregon State University in 1976, and he earned an MBA with high honors in 1977 with emphasis in management science and operations research. 
 
EPIS, Inc., based in West Linn, Oregon (near Portland), provides information on electric-energy prices and market value by applying fundamental economic principles to the emerging competitive energy market. The company is the developer of the AURORA electric market model, uses AURORA to produce market forecasts, and supports clients who use the model to forecast and analyze the energy marketplace. AURORA is used by major North American electric-energy providers, utilities, consultants, and agency and planning groups.

I wanted to check with you quickly regarding taking a month-long position in August.  I would like to buy a piece of NP, sell a piece of SP, and sell PV. I believe that value exists in taking these positions into the real-time market throughout August.  NP and SP are currently trading near flat.  I think the potential for real-time congestion revenue(RT has seen approximately $250,000 so far this month) across constrained paths in California makes this a low risk way to generate value in a low liquidity market. I have discussed a month long short at PV with Tom Alonso. While I recognize the rest of the desk has a position, I think RT can generate good value liquidating in the shoulder hours beyond what could be generated by just filling dailies because of the current price levels.  This also represents a relatively low risk trade (under $10 downside).  I also would like to use these positions as a basis in hourly EOL trading as well.  If you have concerns or questions please let me know, otherwise I will put these positions on over the next week.

Thanks,
Bill"

Please send an email to the group explaining to them that they will be billed if they go over $55 a month.

Yeah that's a good idea.  Some of the bills lately have been bigger then others and that is because of purchases of new phones.  The rate you should be paying right now per employee is $49.99 PLUS taxes which usually adds up to be about $53 to $55 a month.  Granted most of your group goes way over that.  I set Mark Guzman up on a plan yesterday that is 1100 min. per month and he will probably be paying about $69 out of his pocket if you want to cap it at $50 bucks.  Do you want me to send an e-mail out to your group to let them know they should come see me about different plans?    I'll give you the latest report by the end of today from your latest bill.  Also to be aware that if I put everyone on a different plan they will NOT have the free group calling.

Jill,

I need information regarding our monthly cell phone costs. I would like to cap per employee costs at $50 per month on the group calling plan. Effective in October, I would like employees billed for any amount they have over $50 per month on their cell phone. If an employee needs more minutes I would like to structure a plan to allow them to purchase more minutes through us--with them paying the extra per month.

First, TNP now has a 75 MW call on EPE.  The schedule you see on the unit commitment was called in by PNM on behalf of TNP. Lets keep checking TNP schedules real-time to minimize inadverdant on this sale.  Second, SPS exchange now is 130 MW light load, SPS provides EPE 130 MW at the Eddy tie and EPE returns the power 100 MW at PV and 30 at FC. Again, this schedule will have to be verified real time with SPS/PSCO.

**The TNP schedule is verified with PNM and is delivered at Hidalgo. 25 is firm just like the last two years, 50 is econ. and can be varied by PNM each hour.**

A quick important reminder. Recently our disputes with EPE and other SW counterparties have been growing. While I recognize that we have some newer members in the group, it is the responsibility of the senior members of the group to train and help the newer members to avoid mistakes. The EPE system is not overly complex. If you have questions during a shift call ME first. Do not wake up Roger, do not go inadvertant. Our notes on the deal sheet need to include whether the power is firm or econ (again--you should almost never buy econ--). The EPE lending fee was recently renegotiated down to $2. We have to be sharp in our marketing of their system to maintain our ability to lend and to lend at $2. Disputes with counterparties will quickly erase this opportunity. Marketing for EPE, making appropriate choices with regards to the units, checking out with dispatchers on time, and reconciling the CARP are basic expectations for this position and MUST be met. If you have questions, please see me. We will discuss EPE and EOL in our meeting at the start of September.

We have entered into another lending agreement with El Paso for Tuesday, 7/24. I've entered deals to show this in our system as a purchase from El Paso at $4 (fee for lending - to be changed if we end up actually purchasing from El Paso) and a sale to STSW. This is a 25 mw on peak schedule (tag entered by Lisa Gang) to be delivered at Palo Verde. We need to send 25 mws (zero price) to EPE real-time at PV to fulfil our part of the agreement. Following are the terms of these deals:

697528 - STWBOM buys EPE
	 HLH @ PV
	 25 mw @ $4
	 (This price represents El Paso's fee for lending)

697536 - STWBOM sells STSW
	 HLH @ PV

Cuts are on the way. While most can be zeroed out in Enpower (for LD's) like normal, longterm contracts will require an annuity for the value of the cut on that particular day. In the interest of being uniform, the guidelines for cuts are below. 

We will be handling cuts in the following manner:

1. Documentation is priority #1. We need to fill out a cut sheet with the times, the name of the person who called, the tag number, the quantity and price.

2. After attempting to resupply the cut or find an alternate sink we need to carefully document changes in the new enpower workspace.

3. We need to zero out all cut deals in Enpower, we then need to calculate the value of the deals and make an annuity. The annuity must be made HE 1 on the following day of the schedule. The annuity needs to be for 1 mw for the value of the zeroed out contract. In the comment section of the annuity you must include the Enpower deal # of the cut deal and should include an indication of the number of mws each hour and the contract price--for example (4 hours @ 25 mws X $100 per mw = $10,000).

4. Please be as accurate as possible. We still need to be flat in Enpower at the end of each day. And we still need to calculate our daily position.

5. Put all cut sheets in the accordion folder on Kate Symes' Desk.

I appreciate your help and diligence.
Thanks,

Bill

All,
Please be advised that the SI Server Certificates on the primary SI site in
Folsom will expire in about a month.  We are planning to install ISO
issued/trusted Certificates on the Folsom SI servers as we have already done
on the Alhambra server several months ago. We presently use Verasign as the
Third Party Trust.  We would like input from you as to any known issues with
authentication at the Alhambra SI site and any impact you may have seen
after our implementation there.  Please provide feedback to me via e-mail

that we may discuss these in that forum.

Green Room,

Granted, I missed the last game and though I may not deserve to present
an opinion given my lengthy stay on the reserve list, I also favor the
move to D1.  I think better competition will be more fun, provided that
we field a full team (speaking mostly at myself here) on a consistent
basis.  I have started playing again and am hoping to be back for the
Fall season, I also know another player-Nate Stanton (he has played with
a few of us in indoor)-who is interested in playing and is a bit quicker
and better than myself.  So for what it's worth.  D1 all the way.

Thanks.

Greg,

I wanted to check with you quickly regarding taking a month-long position in August.  I would like to buy a piece of NP, sell a piece of SP, and sell PV. I believe that value exists in taking these positions into the real-time market throughout August.  NP and SP are currently trading near flat.  I think the potential for real-time congestion revenue(RT has seen approximately $250,000 so far this month) across constrained paths in California makes this a low risk way to generate value in a low liquidity market. I have discussed a month long short at PV with Tom Alonso. While I recognize the rest of the desk has a position, I think RT can generate good value liquidating in the shoulder hours beyond what could be generated by just filling dailies because of the current price levels.  This also represents a relatively low risk trade (under $10 downside).  I also would like to use these positions as a basis in hourly EOL trading as well.  If you have concerns or questions please let me know, otherwise I will put these positions on over the next week.

Arthur Anderson is an outside consulting firm hired by Enron to keep us on the 'straight and narrow' they audit many of our risk functions and other information as double check that what we say is happening is really happening.

I have been told by people higher up in risk to NEVER question Arthur Anderson.  BUT,  I would encourage you to E-mail Tim Belden or Stacey White and ask them these same questions.  You need to be as comfortable as possible.

When you get a moment, could you tell me what this Power Audit is for? Does Arthur Andersen work for us? That was my impression, but Bill asked and it occurred to me that I might want to know exactly who Tatiana is and why she wants this information before I start handing it out.

Let me know what you know.

Tatiana,

I have looked up all 5 of these deals in the system, and need to refer you to the following people for follow up
Deal # 507713.1
Deal # 528572.1
      Deal # 566541.1

These deals are all West Hourly deals, and can be researched by Kate Symes, our real time coordinator.

Deal # 514141.2
      Deal # 536771.2

These need to be handled by someone onthe East desk,  514141 is a Long Term New England book deal, the other is an East Desk real time deal.  

I am sorry I cannot be of direct help on these, I have data for West Desk deals, but only Term and Cash. Please feel free to call if you have any questions.

Cara,

We are in the process of auditing Power Trading for ENA and were referred
to you by Corry Bentley in regards of support for the West deals that we
selected for testing. Due to the fact that there are no executed contracts
for these deals, to complete our testing we need to receive 3rd party
support (NERC Tag or 3rd party invoice) for the following West deals:

Deal # 507713.1
Deal # 528572.1
Deal # 566541.1
Deal # 514141.2
Deal # 536771.2

We are in the final stage or our audit, so your quick response would be
greatly appreciated.

Please call me at (713) 646-6335 if you have any questions.

Thank you.

Tatiana

Sound reasonable? Or should I be more firm?

A reminder....

In an effort to curb El Paso settlements issues, I've requested several sets of tapes over the past few days. As you know, these are the most reliable resource we have in determining the truth behind our everyday dealings. However, none of the taped conversations I've listened to recently have made mention of the time they were being traded for; many didn't name a delivery point; and some left out a price. 

Because mistakes are almost inevitable in a job as abstruse as yours, re-confirming deals just after making them is a valuable habit to form. A quick summary at the end of the conversation can potentially clear up discrepancies at the moment they're created, or serve as a tool for resolving them if they make it further than that.

(This looks good --though no one will know what you mean by abstruse--you might want to clear up the language regarding summarizing at the end of the deal. Make it a bit more firm and condescending)

As always, let me know if you have questions about this.

Kate"

	This is from a guy on our floor.  He's a summer intern...and this is his Tuesday morning story.  Incidentally I was standing directly in front of the old women picking out some green onions for my omelet when all hell broke loose.  I took about three steps back and wandered towards the kitchen in search of a fire extinguisher.  Didn't find one, and like Scott (the intern) was a bit disappointed in my reactions...ah well.



I don't usually send out a group email, but listen to this shit.  So I am sitting at work this morning minding my own business when all hell breaks loose.  It is about 630am, and most of the trading has subsided for the morning.  I decide to grab the first ham and cheese omelet from the women that are serving our breakfast this morning because who knows how long the food will last...today is a special day because we get a fresh cooked breakfast from a propane grill as opposed to the green eggs and ham that we are used to because no one wants to get up at 3am and cook a fresh breakfast for Enron employees, they usually cook it the night before. So, everyone on the floor is very excited and pumped up about the possibility of grabbing a nice breakfast without having the fear that later in the afternoon your ass would wreak havoc on you for eating the nasty green eggs.  So, I grab the first omelet and the crowd surges toward the two 70 year-old women at the grill.  Everyone is smiling, deciding whether or not they want ham or maybe they will get crazy and add salsa or something.  The next thing you know, straight out of a FOX tv show or ""You've Gotta See This"" episode...this old woman is engulfed in flames like the great fire of Chicago.  The propane tanks heating the stove exploded and the flames are high and wide, raising up to ten feet in height.  The place turns into a frenzy. Nobody can move, react, or anything.  Everyone is frozen watching this old woman(picture happy Gilmore's grandma) go up like an old Christmas tree.  A few seconds before this high school chemistry experiment, I was sitting on the first row right in the middle and I was staring at my two liquid display computer terminals and glancing at the sports ticker on ESPN2 on the 50inch Liquid FlatScreen TV that is directly above my desk. The old woman that went into flames is directly in front of me, about a literal three feet away and I am directly facing the inferno along with a co-worker who is catching the blunt of the heat of the flames. I don't save the old woman like most of you might have thought, I can't do anything but shout obscenities and wonder who the hell is going to jump in there and save this poor lady.  The old woman is yelling ,""Somebody get me outta here!""...yet we all continue to stare.....finally, someone grabs her arm and yanks her out of the blaze.  Who is this masked man, I have no clue.  However, I do witness Les from middle marketing doing his best Maurice Greene directly for the fire extinguisher of which he is the only one in the office that has a clue where it is. I see someone throwing a pitcher of egg yolk on the fire earlier, which is funny, if not for the fact that an old lady is missing half of her hair and her arms are about to blister up.  The blaze is extinguished after taking a hell of a toll on the old woman, ruining the flat screen tv that used to sit above me, and torching a bunch of cabinets and the backs of computer screens.  The alarm in our building 3 World Trade Center is screaming, and the smoke is enough to make even Polarek leave the area.  So, the fire departemnt comes and the old woman is now out of the building and on her way to the hospital.  Who knows what condition she is in, but all I know is I hope I am never around a bunch of vaginas(myself and the rest of us that did nothing) when I go up in flames someday.  Well, I have to get back to work because I have wasted about 20 minutes writing this drama.  Take care, Scotty

I wanted to commend the real time group for their efforts.  For the past 6 month, I've noticed a dramatic difference in the accuracy of deal entry in Enpower.  Accordingly, by the end of the day when I have to route, it has made my job that much easier.  In the past it would take hours to figure out what deals were entered incorrectly.  Now it is very rare that our position manager is off and this makes everyone's lives better!

Alan,

According to this site the cap was around $71 for HE 15 and $72 for HE 18.  We had already traded for these hours when the ""new cap"" had been set.  This is a retroactive cap during mitigation hours.  When trading in the hour ahead market (1 hour before energy flows) we cannot predict the Cap to Market ratio. For example: Expost is $18 right now, and the market is at $91.87.  Any recommendations?

Finance is fine with the change order inclusive of Scott's comments.  Please send us an executed copy, as we are obligated to pass it on to the banks.  How will the payment of the additional $6,000 be handled?  Will the next progress payment (23.5% of purchase price, scheduled for Dec 1, 2001) be based on the new price + the ""catch-up amount"" ($2,850,560.30)?

There's going to be a NERC E-Tag survey on Saturday 17th for HE 1400 PST.  CA's will be reporting who is and who isn't in compliance.  I received a call today to remind us of this from PGE transmission.  Apparently, they have been noting, as practice who's in compliance and who isn't, and I guess our stats aren't looking good.  We just need to make sure we submit tags for every transaction whether is on time or late.

When doing imports and exports at tie points for other desks, be sure to put the other desk as the Customer in CAPS.  This prevents inappopriate charges going against the real-time book.  Import and Export fees are typically in the nature of $5 per mm on a wheel.

Hi Bill,

I wanted to let you know that I had a talk with John Zufferli and he is alright with me transferring to your office subject to you hiring me.

I really am excited about this possibility!  As I said on the phone on Wednesday, I would love to come and work for you in Portland.  When I saw the advertisement for the Real Time Specialist on the Enron website I had to call you to see if the position was still available.  Unfortunately it wasn't.

I learned so much when I came down in June to watch your traders.  I speak with them all a lot on the phone and I am continually striving to learn more about the power business south of the border.  In fact, now that there's potential to come work for you, I'm going to work even harder to learn more about west power trading.

Please keep me in mind when the next available real-time position comes up.  I would be happy to come work for you as early as the beginning of the new year.  Do you know when you will be in the market for another trader?  And more importantly, would you be willing to hire a Canadian?  I don't suppose there would be a problem getting a green card considering I would just be transfering offices for the same company.

Please let me know what you think.

Thanks a lot Bill, and I look forward to speaking with you soon.

I received a call from Warren McReynold at the BPA today.  Warren was concerned with the level of service that our group is providing.  Warren explained to me the necessity and importance of calling in and reporting the actual amount of energy generated by Grays Harbor and Frontier EVERY hour.  The group at BPA cannot close their accounting books and meet reliability performance measures without our information.  I am meeting with Warren on Tuesday.  Warren is inclined to recommend to BPA that we are incapable of this service because of our inconsistent performance.  Such a recommendation would severely limit Enron's ability to produce value for our service customers in the near term and would likely prevent us from attracting new customers.  I believe that we can provide Warren's group with the information that it needs with minimal impact to our trading.

Therefore: 

We must call Grays Harbor and Frontier at the top of EVERY hour.  Then we need to call BPA and communicate the ACTUAL energy generated, not an estimate.  Finally, sign off the hour in the services book.  Les has provided us with the needed information for each day. Reserves can only be used for the hour that we are in, than we must resupply the schedule from a different source by working with the BPA marketers. If you have a question regarding reserves or pulling a schedule--please call Les or me.

If this process takes more than 5 minutes, please let me know. It is each trader's responsibilty to make this work.  It should be noted that we need to do this even if the generator is prescheduled, and must to continue to do this until these generators are automatically metered.  And yes, we will be compensated by the Services desk for our work. 

This service is a priority and should be treated as such.

Please see me with your comments and concerns regarding this job function.

Thanks,
Bill

Kate and Bill:

I have received documents from Settlements indicating the annuities per your 10/10 email (as attached below) have been captured as upcoming prior month adjustments (i.e. pmas).  These are the pmas associated with El Paso clean up for Feb, March, and June 2000 ONLY.   The annuities you entered for Sep and Nov 2000 shall come later but possibly after this month-end (10/31).

The total impact of Feb, March, and June 2000 annuities will be +$108,388.02.  Although they will come through on regular desk analysis for 11/30, since I have received documents from Settlements indicating this $108,388.02 have been captured successfuly, if you like we can take it early, which means taking it on 10/31.  Let me know if you have a preference.

Also, at this moment I am working on all other pma items which you shall expect to go into your P&L this month-end.  As soon as I have them ready I'll send you the details for review.

Brace yourselves...
Once more we are experiencing seasonal changes. The time zone change has pushed the evening peak back to HE 18 through HE 19. These hours are now premium, the load curve no longer resembles a rolling hill but has an extreme morning ramp and an extreme evening ramp. Both EPE and the CAISO in NP-15 will have difficulty with this evening ramp. Do not count on the EPE load forecast to accurately identify the evening ramp. We should not suck off the grid. Pay the extra $3 for firm or unit contingent power in the SW. We need to attack the evening peak early and make sure we cover it. We should be using congestion wheels as hedges. A 200 mw import requires a 200 mw wheel going in the opposite direction at $0.10--or less--we should not do 50 mws at $50 as we would still have to pay $50 on the other 150 mws if we get awarded all 50 mws of relief. We will discuss this in our meeting next Tuesday November 6th at 4:30. Let's be sharp and not give away hard-earned revenue on congestion mis-management or poor scheduling. 

Any questions? Comments? Ideas? Bring them to the meeting on next Tuesday.

Thanks,

Bill"

Sorry for the delay in getting you my accomplishments.  I filled out the self-evaluation portion of the PRC back in May.  I have attached my responses to the self-evaluation form.
My accomplishments and more long-winded descriptions of what I do are in the attachment, by comparison my near-term goals for the next 6 months are pretty concise.

1. Continue to maximize the abilities of the group, and try to leave nothing on the table.
2. Minimize our settlements and disputes over Enpower mistakes, or other avoidable actions.
3. Continue to provide those in the group opportunities to improve themselves and get where they want to go in Enron.
4. Stay ahead of California with regards to political, legal and credit risk.
5. Work with middle-marketing and services groups to develop new opportunities.
6. Improve my education through SQL training and more advanced Derivatives training to better allow me to understand the fundamentals of the market and the movements of spreads relative to market fundamentals.

I greatly enjoy my current position and look forward to the next 6 months.

If you have any questions just let me know.
Thanks, 
Bill

He's a summer intern...and this is his Tuesday morning story.  Incidentally I was standing directly in front of the old women picking out some green onions for my omelet when all hell broke loose.  I took about three steps back and wandered towards the kitchen in search of a fire extinguisher.  Didn't find one, and like Scott (the intern) was a bit disappointed in my reactions...ah well.



I don't usually send out a group email, but listen to this shit.  So I am sitting at work this morning minding my own business when all hell breaks loose.  It is about 630am, and most of the trading has subsided for the morning.  I decide to grab the first ham and cheese omelet from the women that are serving our breakfast this morning because who knows how long the food will last...today is a special day because we get a fresh cooked breakfast from a propane grill as opposed to the green eggs and ham that we are used to because no one wants to get up at 3am and cook a fresh breakfast for Enron employees, they usually cook it the night before. So, everyone on the floor is very excited and pumped up about the possibility of grabbing a nice breakfast without having the fear that later in the afternoon your ass would wreak havoc on you for eating the nasty green eggs.  So, I grab the first omelet and the crowd surges toward the two 70 year-old women at the grill.  Everyone is smiling, deciding whether or not they want ham or maybe they will get crazy and add salsa or something.  The next thing you know, straight out of a FOX tv show or ""You've Gotta See This"" episode...this old woman is engulfed in flames like the great fire of Chicago.  The propane tanks heating the stove exploded and the flames are high and wide, raising up to ten feet in height.  The place turns into a frenzy. Nobody can move, react, or anything.  Everyone is frozen watching this old woman(picture happy Gilmore's grandma) go up like an old Christmas tree.  A few seconds before this high school chemistry experiment, I was sitting on the first row right in the middle and I was staring at my two liquid display computer terminals and glancing at the sports ticker on ESPN2 on the 50inch Liquid FlatScreen TV that is directly above my desk. The old woman that went into flames is directly in front of me, about a literal three feet away and I am directly facing the inferno along with a co-worker who is catching the blunt of the heat of the flames. I don't save the old woman like most of you might have thought, I can't do anything but shout obscenities and wonder who the hell is going to jump in there and save this poor lady.  The old woman is yelling ,""Somebody get me outta here!""...yet we all continue to stare.....finally, someone grabs her arm and yanks her out of the blaze.  Who is this masked man, I have no clue.  However, I do witness Les from middle marketing doing his best Maurice Greene directly for the fire extinguisher of which he is the only one in the office that has a clue where it is. I see someone throwing a pitcher of egg yolk on the fire earlier, which is funny, if not for the fact that an old lady is missing half of her hair and her arms are about to blister up.  The blaze is extinguished after taking a hell of a toll on the old woman, ruining the flat screen tv that used to sit above me, and torching a bunch of cabinets and the backs of computer screens.  The alarm in our building 3 World Trade Center is screaming, and the smoke is enough to make even Polarek leave the area.  So, the fire departemnt comes and the old woman is now out of the building and on her way to the hospital.  Who knows what condition she is in, but all I know is I hope I am never around a bunch of vaginas(myself and the rest of us that did nothing) when I go up in flames someday.  Well, I have to get back to work because I have wasted about 20 minutes writing this drama.  Take care, Scotty

Group,

Our deal with EES has changed. As Ryan indicated in his email we are now charging $3 for EES up to 100 mws, above 100 mws to  200 mws we are charging $4, above 200 mws per hour we are charging $5.  However, when we have transacted with EES for a peaker product or day-ahead schedule we will not integrate our fee into their price for that quanity of mws. I will indicate in an email to you when this occurs. This is a bit complex but if you have questions just let me know.

Also, EnMax has recently been buying energy from us at the BC Border. This turned out to be a ""Canadian"" firm purchase on the part of Enmax. Please do not fill any sale to EnMax with MPC energy. We need to treat EnMax just like ECC. We should buy an option or a call and then exercise that option. MPC does not have this capability and should not be used in this manner.

Finally, the NW evening peak has arrived. The NW has been extremely tight through morning and evening peaks, often over $30 to pick up...

Any questions, just let me know.

We have developed a process for tiering our bids and should do so going forward.

Please use appropriate dollar and mw values. Below is JUST an example. When tiering, the top numbers (mw values) must be monotonically increasing and the last two numbers on the bottom of your tier ($ values) must be the same.

	 
IMPORT:	0	25	50	75	100	125	150	200	200.01

		$0.1	$0.1	$0.1	$0.1	$0.1	$0.1	$0.1	$0.1	$0.1


*NOTE* If a tiered bid is entered incorrectly you will have to flow a large amount of mws for loss or no gain.*NOTE*

Please see me with any questions before implementing tiered bids.

When buying from any desk on the floor, you should have a sale from that desk (say ST-CALI) to either WHourly or WBOM, then do enpower as normal. The interdesk sale will not pull up in scheduling and you will have to route the sale in Enpower to the physical buy by the other desk (another words...ST-CALI buys from imbalance, sells to WHourly/WBOM, then WHourly/WBOM sells to EPMICALPOOL, then WHourly/WBOM sells to EPE.

Keoni,

Here are the details on our sale to CERS for HE 14 at Palo Verde devers.
 
I spoke with Linus at CERS at approximately 11:50--At that time I sold him 90 mws at $29 delivered at PV for HE 14, I told him the energy was coming from the CAISO.

I then called Mike at SRP marketing after speaking with Linus. For HE 13 I had sold Mike 75 mws. I told him the schedule would be going to a zero for HE 14.

I called the CAISO to notify them my export EPMI_CISO_SALSA would be going to CERS at PV devers and not SRP.

I began speaking with Bhavin at the Palo Verde desk at 12:20 regarding scheduling of the energy to CERS at PV devers.

I told Bhavin the export -EPMI_CISO_SALSA- would be going to CERS and that it was effectively a net schedule(90 mws out at PV devers/90 mws in at PV devers).Bhavin asked that I call a counterparty with a control area interest at PV and show the schedule going to and coming from a control area.

I acknowledged this request and called El Paso Electric to attempt to show the schedule to them and from them. I was not comfortable with this step as I viewed it as unnecessary and told EPE I would call them back. I then called SRP transmission to discuss the schedule with them. At approximately 12:40 I discussed the 90 mw net schedule with SRP transmission. SRP control said a net schedule would show as zero.

I then spoke with EPE and told them to forget the schedule.

I called Bhavin back and told him SRP was aware of the schedule.
Bhavin told me that he would make a note of the schedule and show it as net scheduled.

At 13:02 Bhavin called me back and told me he was not checking out with SRP at PV devers.
I called SRP transmission and went over the schedule one more time. SRP transmission still showed the 75 mw schedule from HE 13. I told SRP transmission that the 75 mw schedule was no longer flowing to him. He told me he would call his marketer.

While transacting for HE 15, I again spoke with Mike at SRP marketing and Mike told me he had missed telling his transmission to pull out the 75 mw schedule.

I believe the original problem was the net scheduling and that it was compounded by miscommunication on SRP's end. It should be noted that Bhavin was polite and professional throughout my conversations with him. 


I think the ability to net schedule at tie points is important.  My feeling is that the CAISO schedulers should have the same scheduling capabilities at the tie points as those schedulers outside the CAISO. Please let me know what you find out regarding this practice. If you have any questions for me please let me know.

Thank you for your help.

We need to buy a transmission wheel from BPA (Account#736780) from PGE System to the Montana System Border.  If need be we can also do a Buy-Resale with WWP to move the energy from PGE Sys/Mid-C/LOLO to the Montana System Border.  The method for documentation and cleaning up enpower are below.


1.) In enpower, build an index forward buy from PGE under LTNW book for the total amount of mws cut due to colstrip going down.  Use the DOW JONES MIDC index (remember to specify in the index if it is on or off-peak).  Enter an offset of .10  .  

2.) Enter a transmission deal from BPA.   (MIDC to MPC SYS)  The transmission fee is $2.52

3.) Go into deal scheduling and query  under the counterparty PGE.  Select all

4.) Bring up all deals of the counterparties involved at Colstrip---- specifically, Ashgrove,Conocpil, Energywesr, Louisiana Pacific, and Smurfit Stone, etc.
	(these enpower deal numbers can be located under the counterparties name in lotus notes.)

5.)Zero out the buy from PGE @MPC SYS

6.) Finally link the deals.

7.) Check real time postion manager, make sure you are flat.

If you have questions regarding this procedure please let me know.

Subject:	Two Major Inconsistencies in FERC's Most Recent Refund Order and the Nov 1 and Dec 15 Orders
Importance:	High

The FERC apparently has a very short memory:


1.	In its Dec. 15, 2000 Order, FERC clarified that liability for refunds would only last for 60 days after the transaction was filed with FERC.   How can FERC now say that transactions from Nov. 1 through April 26 are subject to refund?  The Dec. 15 Order said that only transactions that were identified by Commission staff for further review would be subject to continued refund liability.  Otherwise, refund potential for transactions over $150/MWh would close after 60 days.  Presumably, liability for transactions under $150/MWh would close after 60 days, too.

Here is the excerpt from the Dec. 15 Order:

""We clarify that, unless the Commission issues some form of notification to a seller that its transaction is still under review, refund potential on a particular transaction will close 60 days after the initial report is filed with the Commission.  The institution of a 60-day period for the review of the transactions will provide sellers with the certainty they request and allows a reasonable period for analysis by staff.""  Dec. 15 Order at 58.


2.  	In its Nov. 1 Order, FERC said that it would limit refund liability to seller's marginal costs or legitimate and verifiable opportunity costs.  FERC now says that marketers cannot use their purchased power costs---much less opportunity costs---to offset potential refunds.

From the Nov. 1 Order:  ""However, should we find it necessary to order refunds, we will limit refund liability to no lower than the seller's marginal costs or legitimate and verifiable opportunity costs.""  Nov. 1 Order at 39.


FERC's July 25 Order makes no attempt to explain its departure from its earlier holdings on refunds in this same proceeding.  Arbitrary and capricious, anyone?

Subject:	Summary- Judge's Recommendation re Retroactive Refunds

Commenting on his general perception of the settlement conference, the Chief Judge, in his down home manner, did not miss the opportunity to say that ""you can take a horse to water but you can't make him drink.""  Below is a Cliff Notes version of the Judge's report and recommendation issued at 4:49 PM today.  Attached is the complete work.  

The Judge opined that very large refunds would be due- ""While the amount of such refunds is not $8.9 billion as claimed by the State of California, they do amount to hundreds of millions of dollars, probably more than a billion dollars in an aggregate sum.  ?At the same time, while there are vast sums due for overcharges, there are even larger amounts owed to energy sellers by the CAISO, the investor owned utilities, and the State of California.  Can a cash refund be required where a much larger amount is due the seller?  The Chief Judge thinks not.""  Another notable quote:  ""?it is the opinion of the Chief Judge that the amount claimed by the State of California has not and cannot be substantiated.""  

The Judge noted that he submitted a proposal of his own on July 5, which was summarily rejected by the State of California, and that the five separate offers of the various industry groups to settle with California were also rejected. 
  
Refund Effective Date- Refund effective date of October 2, 2000, for sales in the spot markets of the CAISO and the Cal PX.  The Chief Judge's recommendations do not go beyond that date.  ""Spot market"" sales are ""sales that are 24 hours or less and that are entered into the day of or day prior to delivery."" 

Evidentiary Hearing- ""The differences between what the State of California believes the buyers in the California markets are owed in refunds and what the sellers in the California market believe should be refunded raise material issues of fact. The appropriate numbers to calculate potential refunds involve factual disputes.  Thus, the Chief Judge recommends that a trial-type, evidentiary hearing be ordered limited to a factual record to apply to the methodology set forth below.  Because of the urgent need for an answer to the refund issues that hearing should be on a 60-day fast track schedule.  It is important that a single methodology be adopted for calculating potential refunds in this proceeding.  However, such a methodology may not be appropriate for all sellers in the CAISO's and Cal PX's spot markets in an after-the-fact refund calculation.    In any event, sellers not using the methodology should bear the burden of demonstrating that their costs exceeded the results of the methodology recommended herein over the entire refund period.""

Methodology- The Chief Judge recommends that the methodology set forth in the June 19th Order be used with the modifications discussed below in order to calculate any potential refunds that may be due to customers in the CAISO's and Cal PX's spot energy and ancillary service markets for the period October 2, 2000 through May 28, 2001.  

Heat Rate- The actual heat rates, rather than hypothetical heat rates (associated with recreating the must-bid requirement of the June 19th Order) provide the first step in calculating the cost of the marginal unit.

Gas Cost-  The gas costs associated with the marginal unit should be based upon a daily spot gas price.  ""In the event that the marginal unit is located in NP15 (North of Path 15), the daily spot gas price for PG&E Citygate and Malin should be averaged with the resulting gas price multiplied by the marginal unit's heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour.  If the marginal unit is located in SP15 (South of Path 15), the daily spot gas price for Southern California Gas large packages should be multiplied by the marginal unit's heat rate to calculate a clearing price for that hour.  The daily spot gas prices should be for the ""midpoint"" as published in Financial Times Energy's ""Gas Daily"" publication for the aforementioned delivery points.  The last published gas prices should be used in calculating the refund price for the days that Gas Daily is not published (weekends and holidays)."" 

O&M Adder-  An adder of $6/MWh for O&M should also be included with the calculated market clearing price.  

Emissions Costs- Demonstrable emission costs should be excluded from the market clearing price and treated as an additional expense that sellers may subtract from their respective refund calculation.

Credit Adder- The 10 percent adder should be included in the market clearing price for all transactions that occurred after January 5, 2001 when PG&E and SoCal Edison were deemed no longer creditworthy.

Ancillary Services-  Consistent with the June 19th Order, ancillary service prices would be capped at the market clearing price established in the real-time imbalance energy market.  Adjustment bids would also be treated the same as set forth in the June 19th Order. 

Maximum Price for Non-Emergency Hours- Somewhat unclear.  The Chief Judge recommends that for purposes of recreating a competitive market for calculating refunds, the refund methodology should deviate from the 85% non-emergency requirement of the June 19th Order.  To measure the amount that actual prices may have exceeded the refund price, every hour should be recalculated.

Offsets-  ""Recalculating the hourly competitive price for purposes of a refund calculation would also permit the Cal PX and CAISO to resettle all charges for the refund period.  Amounts owed to sellers and outstanding amounts due from buyers would be recalculated.  Any refunds could then be offset against accurate amounts receivable without sellers netting out any of their purchases from the CAISO and Cal PX during the refund period.""

Interest-  Interest should not be charged against any refund amounts unless the refund amount exceeds the amounts that are past due to the seller.

Good afternoon, How are you?  Hope everything worked out in LA.  I don't know if you are still coming up to Portland but I was emailed a picture at work today from opening day at PGE Park (the minor league baseball stadium up here) and figured I'd pass it on.  The picture was taken in the Enron suite at the park, I am the one directly in front of the TV.  The rest of the folks are from the Origination (not Trading) side of Enron, except my boss, who is on the far left of the picture as you look at it.

Portland has been nice the last couple days, though its been raining like crazy.  I went up on my roof last night, the sun was setting and there was a lull between the storm systems moving through.  Beautiful night.  The sun had already gone down below the west hills, but was still reflecting off some of the taller buildings to the east of my place.  There was this slice of deep blue sky extending from the west over my head, and all around were low menacing storm clouds.  A stiff breeze was blowing south to north and smelled of fresh rain.  Amazing.

It should be a nice weekend up here.  In fact, I am taking tomorrow off and getting in a bit of golf.  I am playing an hour north of Portland on a links style course.  If its a clear morning, I should be able to see Mt. Rainier, Mt. St. Helens, and Mt. Adams.  It is an interesting course to play.  Now if I can just get the ball to go in the hole I'll be happy.

Hope the pic makes it to you through our firewall.

Subject:	MPC March 2001

Bill-

  As we have been back and forth for 5 months now, there has to be a decision made on the Montana Imbalance piece for March 2001.
  Kate and I have done everything to find information to support ours or MPC's numbers and we have knocked out most of the issues, however, there are 6 discrepancies that we do not agree on and both we and MPC are standing on our numbers. I have filled out tape requests for these 6.  Please keep in mind, though, that we do not have access to these tapes(and have not had since April). These requests will go to Tim.

  Five disputes are for MW or to add a deal.  These will be deals that we will not be negatively affected by as we will pass them thru to another counterparty.  The only problem I can forsee is that the other counterparty will dispute the 'pass thru', especially since we have already checked out with them.
  Only one dispute (a pricing issue) could potentially leave us with a negative $1500 DPR.

  I need you to make the call today.  Kate has the tape requests in her posession as well as all of the backup information from the research that we have done.

  If I don't hear from you by tomorrow morning, I'll adjust our system according to MPC's numbers until I do.

  Thanks,

  Virginia"

After discussion with Roger, the Four Corners Units 4 and 5 are NOT take or pay.  This means that rather than selling from these units below the Lambda (unit cost is approximately $13), we should ramp them down.  They should still be the last units down (Copper off, then the steamer, then FC's). Because of restrictions on the units you may not be able to ramp the units all the way down all the time. Also, be sure to work closely with the dispatchers to ramp the units back up in a timely fashion. 
I apologize for misinformation on my part regarding these units.  If you have questions please see me, otherwise...spread the word.

Thanks,
Bill"

	We will be taking over the dispatch of Enron Canada Corp.'s Sundance 3 and 4 units for the evenings of July 19-July 22 (beginning at 18:00 PDT and ending at 6:00 PDT every day, except July 20, where the start time will be 15:00 PDT).

Here is a note of things to remember:

?	SD3 will be coming down for maintenance July 20 at approximately 20:00 PDT.  The plant will call with updates periodically.  Please record this information in the dispatch log.  This can be accessed through the 'Albertapower' site.  Scroll down from Fundamentals to Admin, and at the bottom of the page is the dispatch log. The fundamentals site can be found at  http://albertapower/xnav/default.htm 

?	SD4 has all of its power offered into the Pool at $5.  That's 353MW @ $5.  Therefore you shouldn't have to worry about dispatching the plant up and down.

?	ECC's  telephone line (403-974-6900) has been forwarded to your line for the required hours.  You will receive phone calls from the power pool or the plant on this line.

?	The number for the plant is 780-960-7803 and the number for the power pool is 403-233-7403. 

	You will have to access the power pool ETS website in case an energy restatement of our Sundance units is needed.  This most likely won't happen.  In case it does, the site is www.powerpool.ab.ca.   [You must Login (top right hand corner) as John A. Zufferli-this MUST be done on my computer.  Click on ETS, then Submission.] - our passwords are not currently working...so... you can call the Alberta powerpool for help. You can then restate the offers of SD3 and SD4 as required. Unless something changes you will need to fax the resubmission to Alberta Power Pool and have them resubmit it.  

?	If you have any problems you can reach Bill Greenizan at 620-1180 or his pager at  billgreenizan@epagenet.net.

	PLEASE CALL ME WITH QUESTIONS!

Just to follow-up from yesterday. Two key real-time customers would be MPC (load balancing agreement) and EPE (power ""consulting"" agreement). Other customers such as LV Cogen and Valley are important, but they do not provide the market information or the opportunities of these two. As soon as we have something tangible regarding a new company (and likely before), I think we need to visit these customers and get them back.

Ideas?

Thanks for the note and I hope your doing well.  You're right, sometimes introductions sound more like the presentation of a resume than a letter...but I think you pulled it off.

I was able to close on my condo last weekend.  It was a tremendous pain with a bit of the last minute run-around, but I finally got moved in on Friday night.  I don't know about my neighbors yet as I am the only one moved in on my floor so far.  The seller is still finishing the renovation of the place...they are converting it from an old hotel.  My condo is about 8 blocks from my office downtown, so it was great to roll out of bed this morning and be able to walk to work. 

Like you, I am not sure what Brendan might have told you about me...so here goes.  I was born on the east coast (Connecticut), moved around for a while, and eventually was towed out to southwest Washington by my parents.  I went to highschool in Kelso (this is where I met and then graduated with Brendan).  Then went to college at University of Washington in Seattle.  College was good, if a bit long.  I received a degree in Metallurgical engineering and worked as an engineer in Portland for a year doing failure and corrosion analysis (whoa!).  A bit less than 2 years ago I started working with Enron as a trader, trading hourly electricity in the West.  I started out on shift, but now manage the group and get to work a more normal schedule (usually 10-12 hours a day) during the week.  I enjoy the job a ton, the market changes nearly every day and it beats the hell out of staring at a scanning electron microscope for 4 hours at a pop.

With regards to your visit.  I've been in Portland for a few years now, so I should be able to provide a fairly good guide service around the town.  Depending on when you get here and how things go,  we'll have to see if we can get you outside the city to some of the Mountains and the Coast.  Astoria is about 2 hours away and it's a pretty scenic drive out there (especially if you're from New Mexico).  If the weather's nice we might be able to check out some of the resevoirs and rivers around Mt. St. Helens and the gorge...good swimming, hiking etc.  It should be a blast. 

Have you gotten any closer to firming up when you will be in town?  I am pretty open at the start of July, and although it always rains on the 4th (EVERY single year), that's still a good time to be coming up.  Besides, if you ever thought about moving here, you have to understand why its so green...

It was good to hear from you, and if you have any questions you can give me a call at 503-887-3449.

Take care.

I just received this from our client rep detailing their position.
As expected they are treating the Stage 1 as ending at 11:32 rather than HE 23 as stated on May 31 in both their website and on their message net.  
I would like to get FERC's position on this if necessary.  If it is $91.87 rather than $108.49 as indicated in the FERC order, we will use that as a cap as soon as FERC (or you) recommends it.

Thanks,

Bill, the $108.08 price you see in Footnote #3 of the e-mail titled CAISO
Notice: Correction of FERC June 19 Order Market Notice is the highest hourly
ex-post price during the last Stage 1.  The $91.87 price is 85% of $108.08
per the FERC Order.

The last Stage 1 occurred on Trade Date 5/31/01, HE 10 and 11.  A Stage 2
was in effect from 1132 - 2215.  See
http://www.caiso.com/docs/09003a6080/08/8a/09003a6080088aa7.xls , 2001
Emergency Detail tab.

The Hourly Ex Post Price can be found in OASIS under Button 29, Ex Post
Market Information on the CAISO Website. The Order indicates that the price
should not include a Stage 2 and 3 and even though the cancellation notice
of the Stage 1was not until HE23 we are going by the strict definition of
when the Stage 1 was actually implemented.  Hope this helps.

According to this site the cap was around $71 for HE 15 and $72 for HE 18.  We had already traded for these hours when the ""new cap"" had been set.  This is a retroactive cap during mitigation hours.  When trading in the hour ahead market (1 hour before energy flows) we cannot predict the Cap to Market ratio. For example: Expost is $18 right now, and the market is at $91.87.  Any recommendations?

Group,

Going forward we will be transacting with Enron Canada Corp on an over-the-counter basis.  We will provide them with a bid and an offer suitable for buying from or selling to them non-firm energy.  Enron Canada will contact us each morning to inquire about possiblities for export and import.  We should be familiar with the Alberta Power Pool forecast and be aware of the conversion from CDD to USD.  The lead or NW trader will provide Enron Canada with their estimate or feel of the market.  Enron Canada will be trying nearly every hour to obtain non-firm transmission.  If this is an unwise practive from a risk-reward standpoint based on our understanding of the market, WE need to tell them, as they are losing $6.40 per mw CDD on unused tranny with zero chance for return.  Further, Enron Canada wants the opportunity to transact with other counterparties at the BC Border.  If we cannot use their energy they have asked to be able to contact WWP, IPC or TransAlta after giving us first look to attempt to recoup some of their loss.  I do not see a need for this and think there is potential for embarrassment and damage to customer relations.  If we are in contact with Enron Canada before hand (start of the day, top of the hour, etc.) we should be able to get them the best price for their energy.  Be very clear in your dealings with the NW counterparty that the energy is non-firm.  Determine a book-out price if necessary to solve problems with physical flow.  We are basically buying a put or a call.  Finally, I would like to see the communication with Enron Canada improve.  Personal experience and observation has us not communicating with them as closely as possible and typically only speaking with their real-time group at the bottom.  I feel we can do better.  I want to prevent a repeat of this weekend (ECC selling/buying from a counterparty in the US without our knowledge) and do not want the NW being scoured by both Enron Canada and Enron North America.  This is counterproductive for both of us for obvious reasons.  Providing a bid/offer and being prepared to act on it is a change in our relationship with Enron Canada.  This should force a renewed emphasis on communication and market fundamentals that should only be beneficial.  If you have questions or ideas regarding the relationship with Enron Canada please let me know.

Bill,

With the new system, we need to rework the timelines of some jobs that pull data in.  The creation of Customer Finals must take place prior to our pulling in the schedules to create our estimates.  I am requesting that you implement a 3:00am deadline for Customer Finals to be created.  We will run our job at that time that pulls in schedules.  If the Customer Finals are not created by 3:00, then our job will be run again at 5:00am.  We understand that there are special circumstances that arise and we can deal with those on a case-by-case basis.  This is vital for us to have the finals created in this timeline and makes our lives much easier!

If you do not have any problems with this, please pass on this request to the rest of the RT team and implement this timeline on tonight's shift.  Otherwise, please discuss with me and we can work w/ Pete to square this away.

Thank you for your attention to this, I appreciate it!

Bill - does this sound reasonable? Do you have anything to add?


Please make a note of the following. I know we have several new traders, and details often get overlooked in the midst of the learning process. But this is not only information for the new guys a reminder for the old that attention to detail is an important part of the job. Thanks.

1. Purchases made under one book must be sold under the same book. Pay attention when extending deals. If you don't purchase the energy in a particular book, you don't have energy to sell from that book.

2. Specify EPEC as the group when entering deals for El Paso. Also, pay attention to detail with EPE spinning reserves (as a violation is extremely expensive for EPE), also curtail units in the right order. Copper then Newman 4 then Four Corners (Be sure to curtail Four Corners before selling under cost!)

3. El Paso model must tie out with CARP when trading day is done. Check spreadsheet formulas. 

4. El Paso totals should be logged in the reconciliation model (m://electric/epe/epe01/aug01/epe reconciliation model) and all variances explained.

5. Bloomberg deals need to be assigned a $15 FLAT broker fee per trade. If you begin a deal with Bloomberg trades, enter a per-megawatt fee, and extend the deal later with bilateral trades, you're effectively charging yourself extra brokerage because THAT FEE WILL BE ASSIGNED TO EVERY MW IN YOUR DEAL. Can someone come up with a compelling reason why we wouldn't simply multiply $15 times the number of Bloomberg trades done? huh?Please let me know.

6. Most importantly, if you are unsure, call someone who is not.

Thanks again for your attention to these matters.

Granted, I missed the last game and though I may not deserve to present an opinion given my lengthy stay on the reserve list, I also favor the move to D1.  I think better competition will be more fun, provided that we field a full team (speaking mostly at myself here) on a consistent basis.  I have started playing again and am hoping to be back for the Fall season, I also know another player-Nate Stanton (he has played with a few of us in indoor)-who is interested in playing and is a bit quicker and better than myself.  So for what it's worth.  D1 all the way.

Thanks.

Subject:	Re:Fall Green Room Soccer

Hello all,

Considering the circumstances if we don't move up, I think we should just
move
up to the first division. As a lover of european soccer, I enjoy the
promotion/relegation system. It is a great way for leagues to equalize
competition. So we should just take it in the gut and toughin' up and move
to
the 1st. It'll be fun and competitive. Maybe it'll give us more motivation
to
stay focused as a team. I'm all for it. Afterall, we deserve it. We earned
this
move. I don't want to switch and loose the Green Room name just to stay in
2nd
Div.

But this does mean that it wouldn't hurt to have a few more good players
join
us. So if you know of anyone really good, have him join.

Jon--The check's in the mail.

To the first!

Jay

Hi Guys,

Just a quick reminder that I do need to get a $50 from all of you who want
to play on the Green Room's Fall '01 Soccer Team.     The money ($670 2nd
Division or $760 for 1st Division) is due to the league by July 23rd so I
need  you to send me a check ASAP.  My address is 8573 SW Dakota Drive
Tualatin, OR 97062. The 10 games will be on Sundays from 12 -2 mostly some
2-4 games starting on September 9th.

The other issue I need you to ponder is 1st Division vs 2nd Division.  I
know at our last game we decided to stay in 2nd but what I did not know at
the time is it will cause The Green Room to be ineligible for a league
championship (for 2 years) if we are 1st or 2nd in our league since we did
not promote our team to 1st division.  I guess one way around this is to
change our name and Manager (nay volunteers?) and then I doubt the league
would know who we are even though we are basically the old Green Room team
or just to try out 1st division and see how it goes and try and get a few
more power players to make us even better.   Please respond to me by telling
me if you think we should stay in 2nd or move up to 1st.  Also send me
money!  Thanks.

Bill,

Following up on our conversation outage announcement below included an application your group relies upon, known as CAPS, or Enpower CAPS.  The outage will make CAPS unavailable from 8:30 p.m. to 12:30 a.m. Portland Time this evening.  I understand that group will have access to a back up interface but may be without reporting which is available on your Terminal Service version of the power scheduling here in Houston.

I will find someone on the team performing the maintenance to call (800) 684-1336 and let your staff know that the system is back online.  Thanks.

Hope you're doing well and continuing to enjoy Newport...My friend lives down there in Huntington Beach (watch out for him!), he moved down there about 3 months ago.  I have been planning on visiting him for a while.  I wouldn't mind getting your perspective on the city as well when I come down.  Last time I was in LA, I spent a fair amount of time on the Strip and around Hollywood before heading home.  Another guy I know down there works at the House of Blues and got me tickets to Taj Mahal--Steven Segal came out and played guitar with them at the end (the guy was NOT good)--which was nice.  Also, one of my neighbors from college works on the Maury Povich show (I think).  So, I definitely need to go down there for a visit.  I will be in Sacramento towards the end of July (16th thru 18th) and then am planning to get down to LA right at the start of August for work and perhaps a bit of goofing off.  So whatever, if I make it down there it should be a decent time.

Sorry to hear about the possible cancelation of the trip to Portland, hope you can make it (though the deck seems stacked against you this time around).  I will plan for you to be here (so you wouldn't be stuck in a hotel), but don't worry if you can't get here on the 3rd.  Plenty of time for that, as the sun should be out for a while (til October anyway). 

I was knocking around going snowboarding up at Timberline on Saturday (get a few runs in before 10), but I am leaning towards a trip around Mt. St. Helens on my bike instead.  It's supposed to be around 80 and sunny here on Saturday and you can't pass such weekends up.  St. Helens should be gorgeous and since we are in the middle of a drought in the Northwest I want to check out the level of the resevoirs up in the mountains.  We'll see though, either way I will be getting up early to catch the sunrise in the mountains.

So work was solid today, got just about everything accomplished that I wanted to.  No one brought me lunch after working the night shift...but what can you do?  

Anyway, hope the funeral goes well (you know...as it can), and keep me posted on when/if you might get up to Portland.  Oh.  And as for a picture, I'll see what I can do.  Brendan's got a couple, but I don't have any that I can pop on the web right now and send down to you.  I admit, I have been called an Ogre before (I am a bit of a taller, bigger fellow on the soccer field--and some forwards have unresolved issues concerning it), but...well...Brendan should be able to fill you in.  Like I said I will see what I can do about a picture.
Enjoy your time in LA,
And take care.

Bill

Subject:	Hi there!!!

Hey there Bill!

Ok an update and a little explanation.  I'm sorry I couldn't write you
yesterday I got sooo slammed with patients.  But I'm writing you now.  I
just pray that I won't get too busy today!  That probably won't work all
that well since I'm here and not at church where I should be!!!  Catholics
are funny about that stuff.  Yep,  I'm the ""good little Catholic girl"".  My
mom's a first grade Catholic private school teacher, my dad used to teach
CCD and my sister and I do our very best to go to church every Sunday and
confeesion on Saturdays.  It doen't always work out so well if you know what
I mean.  I took a Sunday shift today didn't I?

Anyhow... the POrtland trip.  Let me share with you the dilemma.  Ok I set
aside money for Portland as kind of a mini vacation.  That money is
currently being used to help with the traveling expenses out to the funeral
in LA.  Also my family members (the son of the one who died) was coming up
to Portland just for the day to take Sarah and I to the REALLY expensive
restraunts etc.  So that probably won't happen.  But basically it's the
first reason.  I don't know if I can financially swing a portion of my plane
ticket plus any other details food, funeral flowers/gifts, etc. and still
get to go to Portland.
Plus I'm moving in a month so I'm going to have moving expenses as well!
Ughhh!  I want to go soooo bad!

But things all happen for a reason.  It looks like I may not be able to go
but I did use my frequent flyer miles to purchase the ticket.


Aprox. 3 hours later............

Well I just got off the phone with you, so you actually know all about the
about issues above.  I did want to say though that I enjoyed talking to you.
You made my morning fly by and yes we talked for over an hour!  WOW!!

I don't think I can send my picture on this computer.  I'll try but it may
not work.  Or maybe I will just go along and you can think I'm an ogre (is
that spelled right??).  I tell you what... I'll send you one if you send me
one.  Deal?  I think it would kind of be nice to actually know what the
other person looks like that you are talking to.  Then again some people
look better in pictures than in real life.  I'm not fortunate enough to be
one of those!

Geez... we covered so much in our last phone conversation that I don't
really have anything to say.  Ok you may want to highlight this and save it
because I guarantee that when we get to be better friends you will want to
reference this!! :)

Oh well saved by the bell....a co-worker of mine has just bought me lunch!
He really is a sweet guy.  I'm not sure but I think he's a little slow.
Every weekend I work though he volunteers to help out in radiology and do
the filing and patient transport for me.  He is such a nice guy!  then today
he knows I'm moving and even though he worked the graveyard shift he came in
to bring me lunch.  Awwwh!  I am going to miss alot of people out here.

You mentioned that you had friends in LA you needed to visit.  Any ideas
when that might be?  Because I would love to extend the invitation to you
that oyu have extended to me.  If you are in my vicinity you are more than
welcome to stay with me and I'll show you around.  Unless of course you are
coming out soon then it would be more like ....""ok we are two lost tourist.""
I would love to see alot of the LA things!  Sunset BLVD., Universal Studios,
all of the little bars and drinking establishments in that area!  I hear
they are fabulous!!!  Maybe by the time your trip rolls around I'll be well
versed in ""the places to be"".  Oh there is a must go that I do know of the
Wishire Regency Hotel.  It has an all oyu can eat dessert buffet!  Complete
with chocolate covered strawberries!  Yummm.

Oh I am a fanatic about desserts!

I better not keeping Lee waiting!  He's figitty!  Talk to you soon!!

Nikki

Here is the G&A Expense worksheet to use as a guide for next year's budget.  I've tried to put as many notes into your assumptions as I could find.  For the 2002 plan, I already input salaries adjusted for merit increases (4.25%) and special pays.  Please update the rest of the 2002 plan column and enter all assumptions used to calculate the amounts.  Some examples of assumptions are if you know you are going to attend certain conferences, have a customer outing, plan travel expense per employee, or add additional headcount.  If you could please complete this and send back to me by the end of the week, it would be greatly appreciated.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

Summer is quickly drawing to a close for our summer interns.  

We have scheduled several departure dates for the interns.  Our records indicate that your summer intern, Todd Bland, is scheduled to return to school on 8/17/01.  

We would like to host a performance review session for all interns who are departing during this same week.  

The review session for your intern will be held on August 7th at 3:00 pm to 4:00 pm in EB 35C2.  Please bring the completed performance feedback form for your intern to this meeting along with any other feedback from your team members that you may have collected. 

We will discuss each intern, cross calibrate their individual performances and decide which interns will receive full time offers.

If you are unable to attend this meeting, please contact me at X33242.

We have had some problems recently with the creation of HA finals, with SQL errors, and as a result we have not been able to run reports. If it is a weekend (or holiday), we first need to import DA finals and then create DA finals in CAPS. After this is done we can import HA finals, and create the HA report. If the boxes are not checked, the CISO may have missed publishing certain hours. Please look in the load zones to find what hour-ahead finals may not have been published, or where CAPS may have just missed pulling them in. Sometimes it helps to pull the missing hour-ahead finals in individually. Once all the finals are in the load zones and int. interchanges, you should be able to create the final report.

Group,

We are lending from El Paso Electric on Monday. We have sold 15 mws for HE 7-22 to ST-SW at $62.50.  We are paying El Paso $4 for the service to lend from their system.   The sell to ST-SW is under the ST-WBOM book (#696314), the purchase from EPE is also under the WBOM book (deal #696315-note the price will be changed to $4 on Monday from $56).  Please buy energy to cover this 15 mw short on Monday under the ST-WBOM book and sell to EPE at $0 under the ST-WBOM book.  The deal is physically prescheduled going out from EPE.  We need to schedule the 15 mw going to EPE.  Please do NOT buy from EPE in the morning even though they may be fat.  We are hoping to do more lending with EPE going forward and therefore need to make this as easy as possible for their dispatchers (do not bring up lending to them-it will lead to unnecessary confusion).  If you have any questions concerning this procedure please call me. 503-887-3449 (c) or 503-274-0502 (h).

Thanks,

Good point Bill.  Now that we are sure what happened to #549162.1 is correct, I am following up with Settlements group in Houston regarding the other side of the deal, i.e. #549160.  Somehow that latter deal was not captured during their processes of creating the prior month adjusments details.  I will get back to you as soon as I hear from them, but at least we know now the loss you got was not due to change of counterparty.

If this deal was zeroed out (and it has been after the fact), then we should also have received a credit for no longer buying from MPC (the other side of the deal, 
deal #549160). We should only lose $40 (the net difference). Any ideas?

Virgina and Bill:

During our month-end processes I have researched deal #549162.1.  The counterparty did change as Bill pointed out, but what makes you suffer a loss in the prior month adjustments was due to the volume being zeroed out for HE 3.  Originally the deal liquidated with HE3 (40MWh*$135), HE4(15MWh *$135), and HE5 (20MWh*$135), but on 4/19/2001 the volume for HE3 was zeroed out in scheduling, which means originally you were given too much $ for the sale and therefore we are now taking that revenue you made in HE3 back.

Thanks,
Fran

Virginia,

I have one question on this month's PMA and some questions from last month.  First, for deal #549162, this deal was originally put in incorrectly as counterparty TacomaSupp.  This counterparty was then changed to Tacomapubuit.  Why does a change in counterparty result in a loss of revenue?  Are we being charged for each counterparty again (like EES and ST-Cali last month), if so, we need to fix this flawed tool. 

Second, for last month, we determined that the WBOM book needs a $108,000 PMA for change in price.  The appropriate price is in Enpower, but the revenue has never appeared (Deal #590753). Remember, this deal was originally input as a buy at $320 and a sell at $30 and liquidated at these prices. The deal is now at $320 and $300.  What do we need to do to get this trued up?
Please come see me with questions.

Thank you for your help.

Because we're under close watch by El Paso, would you mind looking over this e-mail to Kathy before I send it out? Thanks....

Kathy -

I requested tapes for 8/17 to verify the amount we purchased from SRP, and attached wave files that have Bert buying firm power (Vanessa at SRP said she'd need to run her turbines for three hours in order to sell at all) for HE 16-18. 40 mw went to you and the rest was sold elsewhere at Four-Corners. Our records also show we bought 50 mw on peak from SRP to cover the lending deal for that day. So total SRP purchase for HE 17 is 90 mw (50 mw lending deal + 40 mw purchase to maintain reliability requirements). 

I'm working with our IT department to get a tape of Todd reporting these numbers to the El Paso dispatchers - I'll let you know as soon as we find that. In the meantime, do you have anything more specific from SRP as to why they believe we only purchased 40 mw of econ energy for HE 17? I'm just not finding anything to support that.

Thanks,

He notes that Enron management lacked an 'honor among thieves,' but predicts that Enron alumni will flourish.  I suspect he is working on the Enron book right now.---sch
Is Enron the New Drexel? 
By Michael Lewis, the author of ``Liar's Poker'' and ``The New New Thing.''
Berkeley, California, Dec. 20 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. is rapidly expanding the American business journalists' notion of what is possible: No story can ever again be said to be too outrageous to be true. 
The boss, Kenneth Lay, was a friend of the current president of these United States, an adviser to his administration and one of his biggest financial backers. The company itself was rated ``strong buy'' by analysts at almost every Wall Street firm, considered a shining example of modern accounting by reputable accounting firms, and plugged endlessly by the business press. Six years running as Fortune's most innovative company! And all the while this same operation was, at the very top, a lie. 
Understandably, people long for some analogy to help them grasp this situation, but really there isn't a good one. 
Other than failed hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management, Michael Milken's junk bond department at Drexel Burnham Lambert offers the closest parallels on Wall Street, and several people have written to me over the past week to suggest it. But it really is unfair to Milken to compare him to Lay. 
Alumni Will Flourish 
True, in both cases profitable trading businesses collapsed because their creditors came to distrust the people who ran them. And in both cases the core business -- Drexel's junk bonds and Enron's energy trading -- remain viable in the hands of other companies that banks trust. 
Just as the Drexel junk bond traders who didn't go to jail went to other Wall Street firms and created replicas of their former business, former Enron traders will soon be making lots of money for one-time rivals such as Dynegy Inc. and Duke Energy Corp. Well before Kenneth Lay emerges from his legal hell, the energy trading business will return to normal. 
But the morality of the cases are entirely different. Whatever you think of Milken's junk bond department -- and I think its sins were minor beside its achievements -- you must admit the people in it exhibited a certain honor among thieves. 
There was never a moment when Milken betrayed the broad interests of his traders for his own narrow ones. He paid himself huge sums of money, but he also made huge sums for his firm. He was careful to watch out for the little people who worked for him, and they loved him for it. The Enron bosses, by contrast, pillaged their firm and left the little people who worked for them holding the bag. 
Different Motivations 
Enron created the illusion that it was much more profitable than it actually was. Milken created an operation which was, if anything, much more profitable than it looked. What Milken hid was the thuggish manner in which he made his profits. What Enron hid was the sneaky way it made its losses. 
(This is something I still don't understand, and would love for some enterprising reporter to explain, as Enron seems intent on explaining nothing. The off-the-books partnerships that brought Enron down appear to have been a mechanism for hiding bad investments in hard assets -- Turkish gas pipelines, Indian power plants and the like. Why did Enron, which made its money as an intermediary, invest in this stuff in the first place?) 
The speed with which the markets have punished Enron reflects the differences between it and Drexel. In Drexel's case, it took a multiyear investigation by the U.S. government, together with a smear campaign in the press, to bring down the business. In Enron's case, all it took was a couple of articles in the Wall Street Journal pointing out, among other things, that senior executives were profiting at the company's expense. 
In Drexel's case, the demise of the firm and the jailing of Milken was pretty much the end of the story. In Enron's, the fate of the company and its leaders may open up a much bigger scandal that reaches right up to the top. Anything is possible.

""it is commonly urged that, in a war between liberals and fanatics, the 
fanatics are sure to win, owing to their unshakable belief in the 
righteousness of their cause. this belief dies hard, although all history, 
including that of the last few years, is against it. fanatics have failed, 
over and over again, because they have attempted the impossible, or because, 
even when what was aimed at was possible, they were too unscientific to adopt 
the right means; they have failed also because they roused the hostility of 
those whom they wished to coerce. in every important war since 1700 the more 
democratic side has been victorious. this is partly because democracy and 
empiricism (which are intimately interconnected) do not demand a distortion of 
facts in the interests of theory. russia and canada, which have somewhat 
similar climactic conditions, are both interested in obtaining better breeds  
of wheat; in canada this aim is pursued experimentally, in russia by 
interpreting marxist scripture.
     ""systems of dogma without empirical foundation, such as those of 
scholastic theology, marxism, and fascism, have the advantage of producing a 
great degree of social coherence among their disciples. but they have the 
disadvantage of involving persecution of valuable sections of the population. 
spain was ruined by the expulsion of jews and moores; france suffered by the 
emigration of huguenots after the revocation of the edict of nantes; germany 
would probably have been the first in the field with the atomic bomb but for 
hitler's hatred of jews. and, to repeat, dogmatic systems have the two further 
disadvantages of involving false beliefs on practically important matters of 
fact, and rousing the violent hostility of those who do not share the 
fanaticism in question. for these various reasons, it is not to be expected 
that, in the long run, nations addicted to a dogmatic philosophy will have the 
advantage over those of a more empirical temper. nor is it true that dogma is 
necessary for social coherence when social coherence is called for; no nation 
could have shown more of it than the british showed in 1940.
     ""empiricism, finally, is to be commended not only on the ground of its 
greater truth, but also on ethical grounds. dogma demands authority, rather 
than intelligent thought, as the source of opinion; it requires persecution of 
heretics and hostility to unbelievers; it asks of its disciples that they 
should inhibit natural kindliness in favor of systematic hatred. since 
argument is not recognized as a means of arriving at the truth, adherents of 
rival dogmas have no method except war by means of which to reach a decision. 
and war, in our scientific age, means, sooner or later, universal death.
     ""i conclude that, in our day as in the time of locke, empiricist 
liberalism (which is not incompatible with democratic socialism) is the only 
philosophy that can be adopted by a man who, on the one hand demands some 
scientific evidence for his beliefs, and, on the other hand, desires human 
happiness more than the prevalence of this or that party or creed. our 
confused and difficult world needs various things if it is to escape disaster, 
and among these, one of the most necessary is that, in the nations which still 
uphold liberal beliefs, these beliefs should be wholehearted and profound, not 
apologetic towards dogmatisms of the right and of the left, but deeply 
persuaded of the value of liberty, scientific freedom, and mutual forbearance. 
for without these beliefs, life on our politically divided but technically 
unified planet will hardly continue to be possible.""

I have one question on this month's PMA and some questions from last month.  First, for deal #549162, this deal was originally put in incorrectly as counterparty TacomaSupp.  This counterparty was then changed to Tacomapubuit.  Why does a change in counterparty result in a loss of revenue?  Are we being charged for each counterparty again (like EES and ST-Cali last month), if so, we need to fix this flawed tool. 

Second, for last month, we determined that the WBOM book needs a $108,000 PMA for change in price.  The appropriate price is in Enpower, but the revenue has never appeared (Deal #590753). Remember, this deal was originally input as a buy at $320 and a sell at $30 and liquidated at these prices. The deal is now at $320 and $300.  What do we need to do to get this trued up?
Please come see me with questions.

Dear Customers-

Effective June 15, 2001, the Rocky Mountain Region (RMR) implemented Rate Schedule L-US1, for Unauthorized Use of the Transmission System and Ancillary Services (copy of rate schedule attached).  This rate schedule was posted to RMR's OASIS website under 'Current Business Practices' on August 4, 2001.

During the month of July 2001, RMR began actively researching after-the-fact usage of RMR-managed transmission and identified some unauthorized use of transmission.  Some of you have been sent letters concerning perceived unauthorized usage in July.  you should receive those letters shortly.

RMR has discovered different causes of unauthorized use occurring within WACM and have attached a list outlining some of those causes.  This list is by no means a complete listing, but rather just what's been seen to date. 
A
 s RMR did not post this information publicly until August 4, 2001, we do not feel that we can charge customers for the instances discovered in July, but please be advised that from August 4th forward, this charge will apply.

Please do not hesitate to call me or Paul Humberson at (970) 461-7327 if you have questions or would like to discuss.

Goodness! Great questions!..I could answer some in 5 minutes but others would be a 2 hour discourse. First, I did get both your resume and letter and have taken it to our Human Resources department. I currently have 11 people on rotation(shift work), and 10 is the appropriate number for me to have on shift. One of my employees is interviewing for another opening on the floor on Friday and two others are looking to move. Julie Kearney (in our human resources department) will be gone today through Wednesday of next week. So by Thursday of next week we should be able to set up an interview schedule and go from there.

Hi Bill - 
I read through the stuff you gave me and I do have a few questions... First, did you get my resume and letter, and did they download OK?  I am looking forward to the interview and, assuming I do well, am anxious to get started.  So let me know about a timeline when you can, please. 

What kind of affect will a west-wide RTO have on Enron?  I saw in a couple of the newsletters that FERC is pushing hard for it.  -A west wide RTO is very good for Enron as it would facilitate moving energy around the grid and contribute to marketing efficiency.

""Wood also proposes FERC initiate a rulemaking on market design and structure, to translate the eight RTO functions in Order No. 2000 into concrete protocols for the RTO organizations.""  Is there anywhere I can find out what the 8 RTO functions are?  You should be able to find more information regarding RTO's on the nerc and ferc websites (national energy reliability council and federal energy regulatory commision) 

A lot of information in the newsletters was about natural gas and the volatility in its cost.  Do you do any trading in gas?  We do not trade gas on real-time, but some of the forward traders pick up gas positions to hedge themselves against price volatility on the power side.
 
Canada -- New Alberta Power Plant.  Do you move any Canadian electricity?  We sell energy to Canadian entities frequently, though we do not schedule the energy into Canada. We deliver the energy to them at the BC-US border. 

The CPUC has suspended direct access switches.  What kind of impact does this have on trading?  How does California's Department of Water Resources and its liabilities fit into the mess in CA?  This requires a bit more of an explanation than I have a chance for here. 

Northwest utilities claimed they took an unwarranted $500 million beating in the 6 months of high spot prices.  A judge said they were ""just and fair.""  Will the denial of this claim affect the trading floor?  Yes, it means we do not have to spend months unwinding trades. In short, its good for Enron--and everyone else who bought and sold energy in the NW. 

Enron and PGE... There is a pending sale of PGE to NWN.  Will this have any effect on you?  To put it bluntly, will you still be able to hire from the outside?  Will the sale do anything to the $100 million line of credit that PGE obtained from Enron?   The sale to NW natural will not affect us other than driving up our stock price. 

How close are we to having BPA's transmission system under FERC jurisdiction?  What does Enron think of that, or do they care?
Dynegy, Exelon, Entergy, Cinergy -- who are these guys?    Dynegy and Exelon are power companies (like Enron)-Entergy and Cinergy are trading regions. And we would love to have BPA under FERC jurisdiction but it will likely not happen soon. 

""Exelon said ... it would reduce its ... 2001 estimates due to power market volatility and ... it would cut an (additional) 450 positions.""   Does Enron employment fluctuate with the market, or did Exelon just do a shitty job?  That would be the latter. 

SoCalEd owes Enron a bunch of money.  What happens if it goes bankrupt?  How does that affect Enron overall, and would it change the daily trading process?  -Bankruptcy of SCE would not affect our trading, but I am not aware of what our exposure to SCE is. I believe it is minimal on the trading desk. 

Tell me about Qualifying Facility (QF) suppliers. This will take a while.

How will ""green power"" enter into your mix?  It doesn't yet. ""Green power"" just makes Oregonians and those in Northern California feel good. 

""Cal-ISO's director of grid planning ... testified that the cost  (of 1500 MW of new capacity) is justified as a way to prevent power sellers' market power and to deal with drought conditions in the PNW and CA that limit hydroelectricity production.  Those two issues loomed large as contributing factors in CA's energy crisis...""  As California creates new capacity, will that impact the ability of traders to do what they do, or will they just have more power to deal with? A long or short market is just a part of trading. For example, the market is currently experiencing some unit outages and has exhibited some volatility as a result. There is still a ton of capacity and the market is not moving as drastically as it might have.

All for now.  Thanks for the information. The acronyms are incredible.  It was like these things were written in a foreign language.  Looking forward to hearing from you.   The acronyms are incredible, but they all make sense after a while. 

John

Bill,

For He 24 EPE was prescheduled to send 50mw to the ISO.  The schedule was cut earlier in the day.  There was no note on the model or in Lotus notes.  When the issue was brought to my attention by EPE gen. I looked in the service book and found a note about it.  I called SRP at 9:30 pst to verify that they were receiving the power.  Jose at SRP said he was receiving nothing from EPE for he 24.  The schedule was ultimately taken out.  SRP later called El Paso and said they were not checking out.  I discussed the issue with Jose and he did not agree that our conversation took place as it did.  I tried to get him to take out the schedule and he would not, so I suggested that we pull the tapes.

We relieved Path 15 congestion for HE 7 on Saturday morning.  We flowed 10 mws from Malin to FC345. This resulted in the 10 mw ""variance"" in the report.

Bill and Chris - this is what I remember as to settlements with the DEC bidding strategy.
Let me know if I can be of further assistance.

Delano will schedule into the Day Ahead market and make a sale at the PX index price.  Real Time submits dec bids in the Suplemental Energy Market for any hours when they believe there is a good chance of being dec'd at a 0 price (the pprice you bid may be different than 0 to establish ouselves in the ISO Merit order - ).  Real Time makes 50% of the difference between the day ahead PX and the dec price (in this case 0).

This brings us back to the age-old question.  During an emergency, how we can tell what the highest price paid for energy by California is?  Their market clearing price does not include all the spot market energy that they purchase.  The CISO has acknowledged buying well over the artificially low federal price cap from in-state muni's (LDWP, SMUD, etc.) but none of this information is passed on in a timely fashion.  And what qualifies one counterparty for a penalty, and another counterparty for a ""do-over"" (could be assessed)?  

We will continue our practice of notifying the CAISO as soon as possible regarding outages.

Thank you for the information and the follow-up.

Bill

All,

I have reviewed documents from the ISO's website regarding forced outages as they relate to the June 19 FERC order and concluded the following: 

(1) During a System Emergency, a penalty based on twice the highest price paid for energy in the hour could be assessed if the Participating Generator does not notify the ISO of the outage within the operating hour of the outage, and 

(2) During a Non-System Emergency, a generator could be assessed a penalty if it fails to report the forced outage within the operating hour. 

If you have any questions at all, I can be reached at extension 7733.  

Thanks,
Donna

	ISO Market Participants:

	As you know, on June 19, the FERC released its ""Order On Rehearing
Of Monitoring And Mitigation Plan For The California Wholesale Electric
Markets, Establishing West-Wide Mitigation, And Establishing Settlement
Conference."" Since the Order was released, market participants have raised
several questions regarding the Order. The ISO has received several
questions and plans to share those questions and answers with you within the
next few days.

	In addition, in compliance with the June 19 FERC Order, the ISO has
made its compliance filing with FERC. The filing is posted on the ISO web
site at http://www1.caiso.com/pubinfo/FERC/filings/ for your review.

	The ISO will host a conference call from 12:00 p.m. to 2:00 p.m. PDT
on Monday, July 16 to discuss questions you may have regarding the FERC's
June 19 Order. The details of the call are as follows:

	Dial-In Number: (877)381-6005

	Conference ID: 1361763

	Leader: Byron Woertz

	Our goal will be to clarify the ways in which the ISO is
interpreting and implementing the FERC Order and to address other
implementation issues you may have. We do not plan to discuss issues that
are pending or are more appropriately addressed at FERC. If you have
specific questions you would like for us to address, please send them to me
by COB on Thursday, July 12 so that we can be better prepared to address
them during the call on Monday. If you have any questions, please call or
e-mail me.

As we figured out a couple of weeks ago, most of our ADS cards have expired.  We were then using Brett Hunsucker's card.  If you remember, we were waiting on the CAISO to send us new cards and new passwords about two weeks ago.  Unfortunately Brett's card appears to have expired this morning as we can no longer log in.  We are consequently unable to communicate with the CAISO over the ADS.  We may now be in violation of our participating generator agreement with the CAISO.  Is there something that I can do to speed this process, perhaps lodge a complaint with the CAISO or our client rep?  Do you have any ETA from the CAISO on our cards and passwords?

Going forward we will be delivering parking or taking lending energy at one point per schedule with Portland General. We will either deliver or take energy from them at Portland General System. OR we will deliver or take energy from them at Mid-C. 

PGE real-time has had difficulty with scheduling the energy in real-time to or from a point other than originally prescheduled. Therefore ONLY schedule the energy to or from the originally prescheduled delivery point. In the case below we would deliver the energy to Portland General System--NOT the MID-C.

We should continue to be flexible at PGE's request. Please see me with any questions.

I think you have identified the most pressing issues. Certainly the ability to go long or short into R/T will be important and hopefully the CISO will follow through on its efforts to ""strive for simplicity and transparency."" Any idea what the penalties for being long or short in R/T might be?  In the CISO's proposal the first two ""goals"" for the real time market appear to be at odds with each other. Also, I think we should push to rid ourselves of 10-minute dispatch at tie points. I understand the CAISO keeping the ADS in-state but it has not worked at tie-points. Feel free to let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks for the update.

Bill

Subject:	California ISO Market Re-Design 2002 (MD02)

	The California ISO has begun a comprehensive redesign of its markets.   FERC ordered CAISO to submit a proposal to FERC by 5/1/02. CAISO is trying to implement changes by this summer and certainly no later than when price controls terminate on 9/30/02.  CAISO's proposed changes are intended to solve long-standing problems such as the lack of price resolution (and resulting gaming opportunities) and problems purportedly related to the ""crisis"" of 2000/2001 (e.g., lack of capacity commitments made on the part of load). Some of the changes being considered include:

Increased price resolution via either:	
	A move to full-nodal model with security constrained dispatch (i.e. PJM),
	An increase in the number of zones, or
	A combination of the two: nodal for relieving congestion, zonal for scheduling load and pricing traded energy.
A requirement that load make forward commitments for capacity
residual forward unit commitment (for times when voluntarily commited capacity is insufficient)
Creation of an hourly day-ahead energy market.
Combining A/S procurment with CM
""Damage control"" price caps

One of our key needs as an energy trading co.  is a need for the market to allow participants to enter R/T either short or long.  This is allowed in PJM.  Also, we will need to be on the defensive against the ability of CAISO to impose price controls.

Please review the attached and let me know (1) other design elements you would like to see (or not see) at the CAISO, and (2) your interest in participating in this process going forward.  Note that a more detailed proposal will be out next week and there will be stakeholder meetings during the week of 14 January.  We may not be able to get someone there in person but will definitely, at a minimum, listen in.

Hello, how are things going?   Hope you've caught up on your sleep from California.  That's what I am going to work on this afternoon so I can enjoy the weekend.  I am so glad the week is over.  I am exhausted.  Nothing like if I had worked 92 hours though.  

Sorry to hear you only have the night of the 3rd open.  Hopefully you are getting to spend more time in the city of Portland than just one afternoon.  There's just too much to do here to only spend one afternoon.  As for where to stay, there's a bunch of hotels out at the airport, or you can stay downtown.  I can take you out to the airport in the morning if you need as I will not be working on the 4th of July.

Give me a call if you have a chance and have a good weekend.

He notes that Enron management lacked an 'honor among thieves,' but predicts that Enron alumni will flourish.  I suspect he is working on the Enron book right now.---sch
Is Enron the New Drexel? 
By Michael Lewis, the author of ``Liar's Poker'' and ``The New New Thing.''
Berkeley, California, Dec. 20 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. is rapidly expanding the American business journalists' notion of what is possible: No story can ever again be said to be too outrageous to be true. 
The boss, Kenneth Lay, was a friend of the current president of these United States, an adviser to his administration and one of his biggest financial backers. The company itself was rated ``strong buy'' by analysts at almost every Wall Street firm, considered a shining example of modern accounting by reputable accounting firms, and plugged endlessly by the business press. Six years running as Fortune's most innovative company! And all the while this same operation was, at the very top, a lie. 
Understandably, people long for some analogy to help them grasp this situation, but really there isn't a good one. 
Other than failed hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management, Michael Milken's junk bond department at Drexel Burnham Lambert offers the closest parallels on Wall Street, and several people have written to me over the past week to suggest it. But it really is unfair to Milken to compare him to Lay. 
Alumni Will Flourish 
True, in both cases profitable trading businesses collapsed because their creditors came to distrust the people who ran them. And in both cases the core business -- Drexel's junk bonds and Enron's energy trading -- remain viable in the hands of other companies that banks trust. 
Just as the Drexel junk bond traders who didn't go to jail went to other Wall Street firms and created replicas of their former business, former Enron traders will soon be making lots of money for one-time rivals such as Dynegy Inc. and Duke Energy Corp. Well before Kenneth Lay emerges from his legal hell, the energy trading business will return to normal. 
But the morality of the cases are entirely different. Whatever you think of Milken's junk bond department -- and I think its sins were minor beside its achievements -- you must admit the people in it exhibited a certain honor among thieves. 
There was never a moment when Milken betrayed the broad interests of his traders for his own narrow ones. He paid himself huge sums of money, but he also made huge sums for his firm. He was careful to watch out for the little people who worked for him, and they loved him for it. The Enron bosses, by contrast, pillaged their firm and left the little people who worked for them holding the bag. 
Different Motivations 
Enron created the illusion that it was much more profitable than it actually was. Milken created an operation which was, if anything, much more profitable than it looked. What Milken hid was the thuggish manner in which he made his profits. What Enron hid was the sneaky way it made its losses. 
(This is something I still don't understand, and would love for some enterprising reporter to explain, as Enron seems intent on explaining nothing. The off-the-books partnerships that brought Enron down appear to have been a mechanism for hiding bad investments in hard assets -- Turkish gas pipelines, Indian power plants and the like. Why did Enron, which made its money as an intermediary, invest in this stuff in the first place?) 
The speed with which the markets have punished Enron reflects the differences between it and Drexel. In Drexel's case, it took a multiyear investigation by the U.S. government, together with a smear campaign in the press, to bring down the business. In Enron's case, all it took was a couple of articles in the Wall Street Journal pointing out, among other things, that senior executives were profiting at the company's expense. 
In Drexel's case, the demise of the firm and the jailing of Milken was pretty much the end of the story. In Enron's, the fate of the company and its leaders may open up a much bigger scandal that reaches right up to the top. Anything is possible.

Bill Williams,
 
    As you know, the Dow Dawgs are an Investment Club at the University of Washington.  KC Anderson informed us of your interest in coming to one of our meetings.  My officers and I are happy to hear of your interest and would like to help you get the word out about Enron. 
    We were hoping you could make it to our next meeting Wednesday (10/24) 5-6pm.  We will, however, work with your schedule and move the meeting to a different day next week.  The sooner we hear back from you the sooner we can schedule a meeting room and advertise to students.  This would also be an excellent opportunity for you to highlight any career or internship opportunities at your company.
 
For more information about the Dow Dawgs:

Thanks,
 
Adam Perino
President 
Dow Dawgs Investment Club"

We will be performing a new service for EES. On Monday, August 6th the ST-CALI desk will have submitted ancillary service bids to the CAISO for EES load.  LADWP will be providing the capacity (SPIN), we will be dispatched over the ADS system, and then need to call the amount into LADWP.  We need to keep track of the amount exercised.  We should do this in the Service Sheet and then record the amount dispatched on the sheet to EES on Tuesday morning as well.  The tags are in the front of the services book for Monday.

Bill -

Would you like me to work with Cara on this? I know you initially asked Mark Guzman to test it, but it appears she may be looking for some kind of feedback soon. Like I said, I tried getting into it today to go through the format, but was unable to. So my question is - where is this on our priority list?

Good Afternoon,

I was able to import all of the Palo Verde Heavy Load schedules into Path Confrimation!  

The sorting and Pathing looks right.  After routing the screen froze completely, but routing was done. I had to end task to get out of the PSW, and we will look at why this error occurred.


With Real time Approval,  If this month goes well for me at PV we will attempt to put everyone on the system starting December 1.  If I do not hear anything from real time, I will assume passive approval has taken place.

There are still some issues with running the build route report, but they are being worked on now.  

I am routing day-ahead to test, but am wanting direction from real time as to whether to route ahead or after the day. Right now the only deals un-routed on PV Heavy are the Parking Deals from PNM and EPE


Thanks,

Cara"

Hello. How are you? What are you doing these days? I hope you are doing well. It has been a while to say the least, but the other day Brendan and I were talking about college and your name came up (oddly enough). I mentioned that I hadn't talked to you for over two years, and was curious what you were up to.  Brendan said he might have your old email address, so I asked for it and figured I would drop you a note.  I hope you don't mind.  

Anyway I am still living in Portland but I am no longer practicing metallurgical engineering.  I began trading power about a year and a half ago for Enron.  I now manage the  west hourly power trading group. The job is great, very challenging and everchanging, though I don't believe my company is too popular down your way right now (you are in San Francisco, right?)...  

My job consumes my time, but I am still playing soccer and still riding that same loud red motorcycle around when I have a chance. I just bought my first home, its a condominium downtown next to the Portland Art Museum.  The place is definitely small but has a lot of character.  It was an old hotel, originally built in 1926, that has just been gutted and refurbished.  It is about eight blocks from my office at the World Trade Center, so walking to work in the mornings is great.  The city is still asleep and eerily quiet in the morning twilight when I walk to work.  The walk helps wake me up and gets me prepared for the morning rush on the trading floor.

So, if you have a chance drop me a line and let me know how you are. This email address of mine works (though everything on it is subject to subpoena by the good state of California), or you can give me a call at 503-887-3449. I'd love to hear from you and catch up a bit, as I often wonder what you are up to.

Take care.

Chris,

I attached a simple sheet outlining our basic process of decremental bidding.  From a Real-Time standpoint we are ready to implement this process immediately.  I believe we have the tools in place to capture the revenue on the volume management side as well.  Kourtney Nelson is out of the office today but will return on Monday.  I feel we should involve her in the process when she returns.  Overall, this is very similar to what we did last summer and should be relatively easy to implement.  Feel free to see me with questions.

Thanks,
Bill

Per our conversation on the phone. We are getting several requests from customers to allow them to ""personalize"" their quotes to only include hourly EOL products.

To whom it concerns,

I had a discrepancy with SRP for a purchase in the hour for HE 19.  I
spoke to SRP at 4:55 and again at approximately 5:02 about purchasing
energy for HE 19.  HE 20 was not part of the discussion.  I spoke to
them about the hour we were ramping into and the hour we were in each
time I spoke with them.  I decided to leave the 25mw purchase in and
review the tapes.  I have made a note of this on the model for 10/28/01.
Sorry for the inconvenience.


Thanks,
Darin L. Presto

Unfortunately the change to $290 was not the final price for deal #620476 on 05/23.  It should be $295 for HE 15-17 and $290 for HE 18-19.  I have checked Enpower and the sheet to make sure that they reflect these changes.  If you have any questions, please let me know.

Bill -

It has come to my attention that several members of the Real Time group would prefer an outing that involves running, hiding, and shooting balls of paint at each other instead of engaging in polite conversation while cordially sipping cocktails at McMenamin's Edgefield. They do not want time to get to know each other in a civilized setting outside of work. They want to beat the living crap out of each other. I am merely letting you know so I can win a bet for $7,000.

First--
All deals should have been made under the ST-NW desk to route with the PGE deal-buy tranny-etc. (I recognize this did not happen but this was my intent and should or could have). Consequently all revenue from this deal originally went into the ST-NW book. Therefore. An annuity was made from ST-NW to ST-WHOURLY. Deal #531524--$23468. Next an annuity was made from ST-Whourly to LT-NW at $5472 to compensate LT-NW for the $48 purchase price (deal #531546). This left a profit of $17996 to be divided between ST-Whourly and L-Pac-30/70. Consequently, ST-Whourly made an annuity to L-Pac for their part of the profit share, Deal #531549--$12597.73. All this left RT with a profit of $5399. If you place all the deals under LT-NW...it will be a large impact on ST-NW, and will result in LT-NW getting paid a couple of times. These profit share numbers are accurate. After expenses--LT-NW gets $5472 for the original deal, then ST-WH gets $5399 and L-Pac gets $12597.73. All these annuities cannot just be killed as they liquidated on the 26th--of February. It is probably a better idea to put everything back under the ST-NW book...ideas?

Good stuff.
 
 
He notes that Enron management lacked an 'honor among thieves,' but predicts that Enron alumni will flourish. I suspect he is working on the Enron book right now.---sch
Is Enron the New Drexel? 
By Michael Lewis, the author of ``Liar's Poker'' and ``The New New Thing.''
Berkeley, California, Dec. 20 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp. is rapidly expanding the American business journalists' notion of what is possible: No story can ever again be said to be too outrageous to be true. 
The boss, Kenneth Lay, was a friend of the current president of these United States, an adviser to his administration and one of his biggest financial backers. The company itself was rated ``strong buy'' by analysts at almost every Wall Street firm, considered a shining example of modern accounting by reputable accounting firms, and plugged endlessly by the business press. Six years running as Fortune's most innovative company! And all the while this same operation was, at the very top, a lie. 
Understandably, people long for some analogy to help them grasp this situation, but really there isn't a good one. 
Other than failed hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management, Michael Milken's junk bond department at Drexel Burnham Lambert offers the closest parallels on Wall Street, and several people have written to me over the past week to suggest it. But it really is unfair to Milken to compare him to Lay. 
Alumni Will Flourish 
True, in both cases profitable trading businesses collapsed because their creditors came to distrust the people who ran them. And in both cases the core business -- Drexel's junk bonds and Enron's energy trading -- remain viable in the hands of other companies that banks trust. 
Just as the Drexel junk bond traders who didn't go to jail went to other Wall Street firms and created replicas of their former business, former Enron traders will soon be making lots of money for one-time rivals such as Dynegy Inc. and Duke Energy Corp. Well before Kenneth Lay emerges from his legal hell, the energy trading business will return to normal. 
But the morality of the cases are entirely different. Whatever you think of Milken's junk bond department -- and I think its sins were minor beside its achievements -- you must admit the people in it exhibited a certain honor among thieves. 
There was never a moment when Milken betrayed the broad interests of his traders for his own narrow ones. He paid himself huge sums of money, but he also made huge sums for his firm. He was careful to watch out for the little people who worked for him, and they loved him for it. The Enron bosses, by contrast, pillaged their firm and left the little people who worked for them holding the bag. 
Different Motivations 
Enron created the illusion that it was much more profitable than it actually was. Milken created an operation which was, if anything, much more profitable than it looked. What Milken hid was the thuggish manner in which he made his profits. What Enron hid was the sneaky way it made its losses. 
(This is something I still don't understand, and would love for some enterprising reporter to explain, as Enron seems intent on explaining nothing. The off-the-books partnerships that brought Enron down appear to have been a mechanism for hiding bad investments in hard assets -- Turkish gas pipelines, Indian power plants and the like. Why did Enron, which made its money as an intermediary, invest in this stuff in the first place?) 
The speed with which the markets have punished Enron reflects the differences between it and Drexel. In Drexel's case, it took a multiyear investigation by the U.S. government, together with a smear campaign in the press, to bring down the business. In Enron's case, all it took was a couple of articles in the Wall Street Journal pointing out, among other things, that senior executives were profiting at the company's expense. 
In Drexel's case, the demise of the firm and the jailing of Milken was pretty much the end of the story. In Enron's, the fate of the company and its leaders may open up a much bigger scandal that reaches right up to the top. Anything is possible.

Subject:	RE: California ISO Market Re-Design 2002 (MD02)

All:

A more detailed version  of CAISO's MD02 proposal was released on Wednesday.  Below I am copying a summary prepared by Andy Brown who covers these matters for IEP.

It appears that the CAISO proposal will allow for SC's to go short or long in the R/T market (i.e., final schedules do not need to be balanced).  That's good.  

I think the most material issue at this point is how the forward capacity requirement (ACAP, akin to ICAP) will affect our trading.

GAC

What is CAISO proposing?

First off, there are ""target price"" and ""intra-zonal congestion management""
FERC filings that are apparently almost ready for a drop at FERC.  The
""comprehensive"" package would build off that.

In essencence, CAISO is proposing a capacity market (similar to what IEP
proposed at the CPUC ""Procurement OIR"") that has an ""available capacity
obligation"" (ACAP) on the load-serving entities (LSEs, aka the utilities and
electric service providers).  This is the solution to the ""all spot, all the
time"" design that was associated with the CPUC's ""mandatory buy/sell""
requirement and failure to provide forward reasonableness guidelines for the
utilities.  The LSEs would be required to show / specify to CAISO the ACAP
resources on a month-ahead basis equal to at least 115% of the coming
month's peak demand.  ACAP resources can be the LSE's own generation,
generation under contract, etc.  Failure to procure sufficient ACAP would
lead to penalties.  Also, CAISO appears to suggest that it would be in the
middle of arrangements between a LSE and the capacity supply as it would
penalize the supplier for failure to be available, operate as dispatched,
etc.  That wrinkle seems like it calls for 3 party contracts or some element
of complexity that shouldn't necessarily be required.  Its not clear from
the paper how costs for CAISO-dispatched ACAP resource would be allocated to
other SCs, particularly where a LSE contracted for the capacity, but CAISO's
running it to cover someone else's short energy schedule?  

It is not particularly clear how DWR resources fit into the mix (there seems
to be a contradictory statement in the paper).  However, CAISO is proposing
a two-year ""transition"" mechanism where CAISO would provide the ACAP
resources (based on their stellar creditworthiness?? or DWR resources??).
There could be tension here with the proposals at the CPUC proceeding.
Also, it appears that an argument can be made that DWR is a LSE under the
terms of AB 1x.  

CAISO is also moving toward a forward nodal-based congestion mechanism,
similar to the PJM type of design.  It is based on a 3000 bus network model
with simplified modeling of adjacent control areas.  Dispatch will be on an
optimized basis that on resource constraints (that appears to be dynamic)
including transmission capacity changes (increased ATC when ETC rights are
freed up, etc.) and generation availability.  There will be some degree of
node aggregation (in the form of demand locations and trading hubs).  It
appears that RMR contracts could disappear under this approach, although
that is not completely clear.

Creation of the forward congestion approach with security based optimization
effectively removes the need for the ""balanced schedule"" requirement.  Under
the proposal, CAISO would make trades happen in realtime through the
optimization to the extent not addressed through the forward markets. CAISO
calls for the resurrection of a day ahead energy market (FERC has called for
that).  CAISO says its open to that market being run outside of CAISO, but
that the need is for a centralized day ahead energy market that could help
shape resource needs.

CAISO would have the ability to dispatch identified ACAP resources not
already scheduled by the LSE.  They speak in terms of a ""residual unit
commitment"" requirement ... something akin to the ""long lead time"" proposal
under the ""must-offer"" requirement.  Their start and min load payment
proposal would be continued, subject to loosing it for unavailability or
participation in the market.  

Note that CAISO states they will need to mitigate bids due to ""locational
market power"", particularly in relation to congestion.  I thought that
locational market power was addressed via RMR.  This raises the ""black box""
issue if CAISO is going to say on a realtime basis that they have some
dynamic problem and only a particular generation asset could address the
problem so we're mitigating your bid curve based on some form of proxy
pricing mechanism.  To some extent, in a nodal system, CAISO could argue
that more folks have ""locational market power.""  We'll need to review other
markets' treatment of this issue.

The future of the AS markets is questioned in the paper, and there's the
specific suggestion that the replacement reserve market is unnecessary if
ACAP is put into place.  This is probably the largest hole in the paper,
because there's a clear implication that something should happen and
presumably CAISO has at least come up with some set of options on the issue
(i.e., kill AS, have AS markets but alter products, have one AS product but
expect low volume, etc).

One element that seemed missing was a discussion of demand response.  In
many respects that element has been consistently missing in the market, save
the extraordinary conservation last summer.  There is a suggestion that the
ACAP requirement could be addressed by demand response, but presumably that
would need to be demand that could be dispatched by CAISO, and those
resources are particularly limited under the current CAISO demand-side
design.  While efforts on interruptible programs has occurred at the CPUC,
it is not clear that the two entities are heading in the same direction.

It was noted earlier that the ACAP proposal is similar to what IEP (and
others) suggested at the CPUC Procurement OIR.  Based on a lone comment by a
CPUCer during the CAISO media call yesterday, the CPUC is very far behind
the curve on these issues, and there is absolutely no coordination on this
issue.  Given that the same ""solution"" is popping up in both venues, there
is a real need to make sure that the two pieces can fit together, while
avoiding a bureaucratic paralysis that could happen if a formal attempt to
""coordinate"" the venues is proposed.

I'm glad to know that I have only one purpose here. If that's the case, then maybe I should just start taking the other three weeks of the month off. And the purpose was NOT not to settle October - which is of course something I await with bated breath. The purpose was to relieve some of the pressure I'm starting to feel and ideally return with renewed motivation to do my job well. While I realize this should be something I do all the time, without occasional days off for incentive, I think you can understand that sometimes it just doesn't work that way. I can hardly believe I'm so indispensible you couldn't survive two days without me with a week's notice. Come on....

I attached a simple sheet outlining our basic process of decremental bidding.  From a Real-Time standpoint we are ready to implement this process immediately.  I believe we have the tools in place to capture the revenue on the volume management side as well.  Kourtney Nelson is out of the office today but will return on Monday.  I feel we should involve her in the process when she returns.  Overall, this is very similar to what we did last summer and should be relatively easy to implement.  Feel free to see me with questions.

Thanks,
Bill

So Kate probably is not any more stressed out than anyone else. She probably just shows it a bit more.
We shouldn't be holding you guys back too much longer.

According to BPA we are almost their on Grays. The only change is that Enron needs to report the total generator output which as indicated on the prescheduled sheet is 6Mw. One Mw is going to Grays Harbor PUD and we have no responsibility other than to report the total generator output.

I've sent to BPA on a prescheduled basis all the prescheduled so that shouldn't be a issue.

The good news is that on Oct. 1 Grays will no longer be our customer and BPA is saying they'll have a automatic system in place to record these numbers automatically by Mid August so hang in there.

Good morning, hope you had a good weekend.
I have run the SAR for Friday's West-BOM piece.  The SAR and INC sheet are matching if the 42 mw purchase from the imbalance at $44 is factored in--Remember, we were cut for HE 10 when Palo Verde 2 went down, this is a RT cut and is not in CAPS. Please make sure that the $44 is accounted for under ST-WBOM in the Volume Management flash.  You may want to walk over and ""remind"" them of this.

I am running the SAR for Saturday through Monday.  Hopefully everything will work.  If you need anything over the next few days, give me a call on my cell.
John Anderson will be in at 8.  Could you also look into getting him set up with his access to our systems.

Subject:	Unit Outages & Communicating with the ISO

After slugging it out with the ISO last week I think we understand the protocols for communicating with them re: unit outages.  We need to communicate with 2 different groups:  the Generation Outage Desk and the Real Time Desk.  First, we fill out an outage report and send it to the Generation Outage Desk.  When the outage is over or the period of the outage changes, we are required to telephone the Real Time Outage Desk.  That phone number is 916/351-2488.  When the calls come in to Real Time from the ISO asking about the outages, they are following up on reports we have filed to see if our outage is ending as planned.

The Services Desk will be responsible for communicating with both the Generation Outage Desk and the Real Time Outage Desk, but Real Time should try to be aware of all outages and be able to communicate with the ISO when they call.  Services will communicate outages to Real Time.

Thanks

I have a few questions regarding the emminent implementation of the new target pricing mechanism.
1. Does uninstructed energy still get paid (if not, we cannot hedge financials)
2. The CISO Table 1. lists an unintended consequence as "" Target price may be manipulated due to no obligation to deliver""
	Why is there no obligation to deliver?
3. Is there still a load deviation penalty? Or would that be considered seperately?

Thanks for the help.

All:

Note that the plan to clear overlapping incs and decs is NOT the immediate change.  In the short run, CAISO will imput supplemental bids at cost based on heat rates, gas prices, etc. (Read the bottom half of this first).

I am attaching an other CAISO document on this topic.

If you want a briefing on these changes, please let me know.

Other than the imposition of penalties, I think we are generally supportive of the L-T fix, which will be made via a tariff change (i.e., we will have an opportunity to comment).

MARKET NOTICE
October 24, 2001
Implementation of Revised Target Price Methodology
ISO Market Participants:
SC Settlements Contacts:
Effective Monday, October 29, 2001 the California Independent System
Operator Corporation (""ISO"")  will revise its methodology for calculating
the Target Price (""TP""). Provided below is a background on TP, a brief
description of the ISO's current thinking about a long-range solution and
potential implementation schedule, and the ISO's current short-range TP
methodology to be implemented on October 29, 2001.   
Background
The ISO operates a Real-Time Market for Imbalance Energy (""IE"")  based on
bids submitted by Market Participants seeking to sell incremental and/or
decremental Imbalance Energy.  In many cases, bids have a ""price overlap,""
which occurs when some Scheduling Coordinators (""SCs"") are willing to buy
real-time energy (i.e., they have submitted decremental IE bids to reduce
their generator output) at prices higher than the prices at which other SCs
are willing to sell real-time energy (i.e., they have submitted incremental
IE bids to increase their generator output).  
In March 1998, the ISO instituted the TP to eliminate the price overlap
described above. The TP is a calculated price between the highest
decremental bid and the lowest incremental bid.  All incremental bids above
the TP are adjusted down to the TP and all decremental bids below the TP are
adjusted up to it.
Though designed to resolve the price overlap, there are certain difficulties
with the TP as it was implemented.  The major problem was that the ISO
cannot ""clear the overlap,"" i.e., accept all overlapping bids and require
the bidders to actually buy and sell at these prices.  SCs can, and do, use
the inability of the ISO to clear the price overlap to manipulate the TP by
submitting unrealistically high offers to buy and unrealistically low offers
to sell, knowing that the ISO can not require the bidders to fulfill their
bids. 
In April 2000, the ISO sought to eliminate this gaming opportunity by
changing the formula f74or calculating the TP.  As a result, there were many
hours when the TP -- and the published price for Real Time Energy
transactions - was zero.  Thus, while the revised methodology reduced gaming
opportunities, it also produced unrealistic real-time prices that distorted
incentives for SCs to bid into the ISO's Real-Time Market.
Long-Range Solution
After extensive internal review and discussion with Stakeholders, the ISO
has concluded that the best solution is to accept overlapping bids, thus
entirely eliminating the need for the TP.  At its September 20, 2001
meeting, the ISO Governing Board approved this concept.  This long-range
solution will require an ISO Tariff and certain computer software changes
and will not be implemented until approximately Summer, 2002.   Detailed
below is the ISO's interim, short-term TP methodology that will become
effective three business days after this Market Notice, on October 29, 2001.
Short-Range Solution
Also described in the ISO staff memorandum presented at the September 20,
2001 ISO Governing Board meeting and as discussed at the October 3, 2001 and
11, 2001 Market Issues Forum meetings, the ISO will implement an interim
solution to address some of the difficulties with the current methodology
until the ISO can implement the longer-range solution.  Thus, by this Market
Notice, Market Participants are noticed that the ISO will implement the TP
methodology described herein effective Monday, October 29.  
The revised methodology is similar to the original TP methodology, but
features several important enhancements to limit gaming opportunities by
incorporation of Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (""FERC"") orders for
price mitigation, limiting the ability of Participating Generators and
Participating Loads to set the TP, and permitting only feasible bids to be
eligible to set the TP.  
Under the original TP methodology, as established in March 1998, a TP
replaced all bid prices within the incremental - decremental price overlap.
The TP was calculated as the market-clearing price (""MCP"") that would result
if the overlapping incremental and decremental bids were matched with one
another and Dispatched in merit order through BEEP.  Graphically, this
Target Price can be calculated as the intersection between the incremental
supply curve and the mirror image of the decremental supply curve over the
price axis, as shown in Figure 1. 

 <<...OLE_Obj...>> 
Figure 1. Price overlap elimination by Target Price

The interim, or short-range, TP methodology differs from the original TP
methodology in the following ways: 
*	Only bids from Generating Units under Participating Generator
Agreements (""PGA"") or Loads with Participating Load Agreements (""PLA"") will
be eligible to set the TP.  This restriction is needed to ensure compliance
with FERC requirements that only participating resources are eligible to set
the MCP.  When the ISO does not Dispatch Imbalance Energy, the TP will
become the MCP.  Thus, only Generators with PGAs and Loads under PLAs will
be eligible to set the TP.  For this reason, inter-tie transactions will not
be eligible to set the TP.
*	Only capacity that can be Dispatched within 10 minutes will be
eligible to set the TP.  This requirement ensures that the TP can only be
set by Generating Units that actually can be Dispatched to meet California's
Load.  This capacity will be based on the total of all Energy and Capacity
products and services bids submitted by each Generating Unit.    For
example, a Generating Unit with a 1MW/minute ramp rate can only increase or
decrease its output by 10 MW within a 10-minute interval, regardless of the
combination of Ancillary Services capacity and Supplemental Energy bids it
has submitted  Thus, its qualifying capacity would be 10 MW.  Priority in
allocating bids to the qualifying capacity will be based first on lowest bid
price, and then on increasing qualities of service.  Although only
qualifying capacity will be considered in the TP calculation, all bids
within the price overlap will be adjusted to the resulting TP.
*	As a final adjustment, the TP will not be higher than the lowest
available gas-fired resource proxy price, as calculated for the
corresponding hour, unless such a proxy price is below the bottom of the
price overlap.  In any such case, the TP will be set to the lowest
incremental Energy bid. The Target Price will also not exceed the applicable
Price Cap.  This provision will ensure that bids dispatched under the TP
will conform to the FERC's requirements on market mitigation pricing.
The short-term TP methodology will use the following equation:
	TP? = max{0, min{TP, LPP, PRC }, LIP}	(1)
where:
TP?	is the adjusted Target Price;	
TP	is the Target Price that clears the price overlap;	
LPP	is the lowest proxy price (applicable to gas-fired resources)	
LIP	is the lowest incremental price.	
PRC	is the applicable Price Cap.

I thought your email regarding the running of CONG with a heuristic rather than optimal solution may address and solve the problem. I have not yet been able to pull up ""corrected"" prices but hopefully they will now reflect our bids. The problems I referred to in my phone message last week were similar to what my original email detailed. Basically, we were awarded mw's on a congestion management schedule and the published prices did not match our bids. Will the change in running the ""solutions"" change this? Our volume management group will then be inputing our bid price rather than the published congestion management price--as those prices are not yet published correctly. 

I will be in the office this week and can be reached at your convenience.

Thanks,
Bill

""it is commonly urged that, in a war between liberals and fanatics, the 
fanatics are sure to win, owing to their unshakable belief in the 
righteousness of their cause. this belief dies hard, although all history, 
including that of the last few years, is against it. fanatics have failed, 
over and over again, because they have attempted the impossible, or because, 
even when what was aimed at was possible, they were too unscientific to adopt 
the right means; they have failed also because they roused the hostility of 
those whom they wished to coerce. in every important war since 1700 the more 
democratic side has been victorious. this is partly because democracy and 
empiricism (which are intimately interconnected) do not demand a distortion of 
facts in the interests of theory. russia and canada, which have somewhat 
similar climactic conditions, are both interested in obtaining better breeds  
of wheat; in canada this aim is pursued experimentally, in russia by 
interpreting marxist scripture.
     ""systems of dogma without empirical foundation, such as those of 
scholastic theology, marxism, and fascism, have the advantage of producing a 
great degree of social coherence among their disciples. but they have the 
disadvantage of involving persecution of valuable sections of the population. 
spain was ruined by the expulsion of jews and moores; france suffered by the 
emigration of huguenots after the revocation of the edict of nantes; germany 
would probably have been the first in the field with the atomic bomb but for 
hitler's hatred of jews. and, to repeat, dogmatic systems have the two further 
disadvantages of involving false beliefs on practically important matters of 
fact, and rousing the violent hostility of those who do not share the 
fanaticism in question. for these various reasons, it is not to be expected 
that, in the long run, nations addicted to a dogmatic philosophy will have the 
advantage over those of a more empirical temper. nor is it true that dogma is 
necessary for social coherence when social coherence is called for; no nation 
could have shown more of it than the british showed in 1940.
     ""empiricism, finally, is to be commended not only on the ground of its 
greater truth, but also on ethical grounds. dogma demands authority, rather 
than intelligent thought, as the source of opinion; it requires persecution of 
heretics and hostility to unbelievers; it asks of its disciples that they 
should inhibit natural kindliness in favor of systematic hatred. since 
argument is not recognized as a means of arriving at the truth, adherents of 
rival dogmas have no method except war by means of which to reach a decision. 
and war, in our scientific age, means, sooner or later, universal death.
     ""i conclude that, in our day as in the time of locke, empiricist 
liberalism (which is not incompatible with democratic socialism) is the only 
philosophy that can be adopted by a man who, on the one hand demands some 
scientific evidence for his beliefs, and, on the other hand, desires human 
happiness more than the prevalence of this or that party or creed. our 
confused and difficult world needs various things if it is to escape disaster, 
and among these, one of the most necessary is that, in the nations which still 
uphold liberal beliefs, these beliefs should be wholehearted and profound, not 
apologetic towards dogmatisms of the right and of the left, but deeply 
persuaded of the value of liberty, scientific freedom, and mutual forbearance. 
for without these beliefs, life on our politically divided but technically 
unified planet will hardly continue to be possible.""

I have discussed our lack of handsets with Dave Steiner.  Dave perceives an appetite for handsets in the real-time group, however, we should be getting new handsets (two for each turret) early next week.  These handsets will be labeled Real-Time, this should prevent others from switching out our handsets.  If one of these handsets stops working (cuts out or mute doesn't work) please let me know. Dave Steiner will be providing these handsets without charging us, but if a heightened handset consumption continues, we will have to pay for them.  Dave suggested that we make sure to hang up the handsets, as they tend to get damaged quickly on the ground (apparently it stresses the connections and leads to them cutting out). I feel this goes without saying but maybe...

Thanks for your help with this.

Sound reasonable? Or should I be more firm?

A reminder....

In an effort to curb El Paso settlements issues, I've requested several sets of tapes over the past few days. As you know, these are the most reliable resource we have in determining the truth behind our everyday dealings. However, none of the taped conversations I've listened to recently have made mention of the time they were being traded for; many didn't name a delivery point; and some left out a price. 

Because mistakes are almost inevitable in a job as abstruse as yours, re-confirming deals just after making them is a valuable habit to form. A quick summary at the end of the conversation can potentially clear up discrepancies at the moment they're created, or serve as a tool for resolving them if they make it further than that.

As always, let me know if you have questions about this.

This is a procedure that we received from the CAISO via WPTF and Sue Mara.  It is a draft.

It fits with a more formal procedure posted last friday but shows some detail on what parties consuming R/T energy will be charged. Basically they will be charged a combiniation of the MCP and OOM costs.

Note that CERS pays OOM suppliers on a bilateral basis within 20-30 days.  Sounds like a good market to sell to while it lasts.

Steph,

Good morning! How are you doing? It seems like I haven't seen you or Scott forever. Things are going well here in Portland. The bankruptcy of Enron has been a bit rough, but I am optimistic that the auction on January 11th will see the trading portion of our business bought out by a credit-worthy entity. If we are bought out, we should be back up and running by early spring. Right now, I am just working on systems upgrades and trying to learn as much as I can so we are ready to rip when we have credit again. Portland has been fun the past couple weeks, there are a few new clubs and living downtown continues to be a blast. I enjoy being able to walk everywhere and being downtown has really aided the Christmas shopping. I haven't been up to Seattle in a long time but I need to get up there. I am thinking about coming up for New Year's... any good ideas?
 
Anyway, hope you are doing well and are all ready for the holidays.
Take care,

Bill"

Tim,

Probably 3 to 5 months ago David Poston demonstrated a new position manager to work with both FSP and Enpower. David Poston showed the position manager to me, Cara Semperger, and Phil Platter. Dave suggested that the new position manager would replace the current stand-alone position managers in CAPS and Enpower. When Dave and I ran through the demonstration, I was told that the East desk had driven most of the development work to date. The functionality of the position manager in the stage Dave presented to me seemed useful, with little development needed for us to implement it. The position manager looked like it would offer several improvements over Real-Time's current position and report reconciliation methods. My impression of the application was that it would be a portion of FSP when implemented and was not a stand alone application. Within a week after demostrating the new position manager, Dave relayed to me that production of the position manager would be delayed until after FSP was in production. As a result of the FSP delay, I have heard nothing of the position manager and have had no input on it since that first meeting. I think this application (as I saw it last) has the potential to improve our reports and reduce our time spent running them. This application should be of benefit to preschedulers, risk and deal control. Now that the position manager is back on the table, I would like the real-time group to be involved in the implementation of this portion of FSP and work to improve its ability to act as a report reconciliation tool.

If you have any questions please let me know.

We have entered into another lending agreement with El Paso for Tuesday, 7/24. I've entered deals to show this in our system as a purchase from El Paso at $4 (fee for lending - to be changed if we end up actually purchasing from El Paso) and a sale to STSW. This is a 25 mw on peak schedule (tag entered by Lisa Gang) to be delivered at Palo Verde. We need to send 25 mws (zero price) to EPE real-time at PV to fulfil our part of the agreement. Following are the terms of these deals:

697528 - STWBOM buys EPE
	 HLH @ PV
	 25 mw @ $4

K:

Clearly there is some weird stuff going on here.  In addition to not
getting the instructions through ADR, it looks to me like we are getting
dispatched for some strange quantities.  My theory is we have reduced
the PMAX on some of these units through formal unit outages, but the ISO
dispatch system does not communicate with the unit outage system.  Can
we check this theory for the dispatch on September 4 for Harbgn_7_units?
Your spreadsheet is showing a dispatch of 7.92 MW.  Our records indicate
that Harbor's PMax is 80 MW as we changed the PMax some time ago.  I
believe the old PMax was approx. 87 and maybe even 87.92.  Can you check
on this?  This might help explain what's going on.

Subject:	As the CAISO Turns:  CAISO involved in scam with CDWR to purchase excess power from CDWR's long-term contracts

Everyone,

This is hot news showing that the CAISO/CDWR relationship is even more cozy than we thought.  I am not sure how to best use this information, but this scam needs to be brought to the public's and FERC's attention.

1.  According to two sources, the CAISO is helping to bail Gov. Davis out of his high-priced CDWR long-term power contracts by purchasing CDWR's excess energy as an ""Out Of Market"" purchase---instead of purchasing real-time energy from the CAISO's Supplemental Energy auction as required by the CAISO Tariff.  The costs of purchasing this high-cost power is being charged to Scheduling Coordinators who are largely unaware of the CAISO's surreptitious transactions.

2.  This sweetheart deal violates the CAISO Tariff, which requires the CAISO to buy energy from its Supplemental Energy (Real-Time) auction first.  CAISO Tariff, Dispatch Protocol section 8.6.2 (d).  Only after the CAISO has used up the Supplemental Energy  bids, can the CAISO buy Out Of Market (""OOM"") energy.  If the CAISO were following the Tariff, CDWR's excess energy would be treated as an uninstructed deviation and CDWR would be paid the clearing price for Supplemental Energy---which is often as low as $0.00.  Therefore, under the Tariff the CAISO could have paid CDWR the same price paid to other SCs, but instead is buying it at a price agreeable to CDWR.  

3.  By ignoring Supplemental Energy bids in favor of CDWR power, the CAISO is able to manipulate the price it pays for energy in the Supplemental Energy market.  Low CAISO demand for Supplemental Energy drives down prices.  The clearing price for Supplemental Energy has often been as low as $0.00.  Therefore, the CAISO gets to keep all excess energy on the grid for free.  If CDWR was not getting preferential treatment, its energy would be treated as excess energy, and it would get little or nothing for it.

4.  While there is no evidence that Gov. Davis has directed the CAISO to buy from CDWR first, this behavior clearly benefits Davis.  Absent the CAISO's purchases of CDWR's excess energy, CDWR would be forced to sell its energy at a huge loss in the open market (just like many other suppliers).  The media has been been making hay out of Davis's strategy of buying high and selling low.  Therefore, Davis and CDWR benefit by being able to offset some of their losses under the long-term contracts.  Of course, they are only able to offset their losses through a back-door deal with the CAISO.

5.  The costs of this expensive CDWR power are being passed through to unwitting Scheduling Coordinators who, frequently seeing 10-minute Ex Post prices of $0.00, expect that the cost of imbalance energy will be close to $0.00.  These SCs are in for a big surprise.  According to one source at Sierra Pacific, the CAISO charged him as much as $400/MWh for imbalance energy.  (Where is the price mitigation here?)

6.  Who benefits under this scam?  Davis and CDWR.  Who loses under this scam?  In-state generators who are currently obligated to sell to the CAISO; Scheduling Coordinators who overgenerate or that have negative imbalances; consumers who end up paying higher prices for energy.

7.  Sources:  Our client representative from the CAISO has confirmed this practice and ""the Friday Burrito,"" an industry insider publication mentioned it also.

8.  Here is the quote from the Friday Burrito:

""There is another problem that is being introduced by the long-term contracts. The ISO is utilizing the DWR contracts as Out of Market (OOM) calls, thereby forcing the contract energy into the grid ahead of the supplemental energy bids in the balancing energy ex post (BEEP) market. As one of our faithful observers told me, ""The ISO will be billing some DRW/CERS long-term contracts to SCs as OOM energy. This has been confirmed by the ISO. This means there is no real-time price transparency. We may see an hourly ex-post price of, say, $15, but this will bear no resemblance to the eventual Real-Time settlement price. There is no way to estimate what the OOM charge was as the ISO doesn't post that information. The implication is that parties buying real-time energy will wait 90 days before theyhave any idea of the price. This sort of price uncertainty is completely contrary to the FERC's goals of creating open, transparent markets."" 
9.  Here is the e-mail from our CAISO representative:

Can you send me a copy of the 'Burrito' that we were discussing, or at
least outline in an e-mail the name of the person who has written about
CERS and what was published?   What is the official name of this
newsletter?  I have seen them in the past (Harvey Hall used to get it
and sent a couple to me), but I haven't seen it for a long time.

Also, to recap our telephone discussion:  the charges assessed to the
Market in Charge Type 487 are determined by CERS, and are being
collected by the ISO on behalf of CERS, to cover the cost of contracts
that CERS has signed for energy purchases? and 487 pricing/charges have
do direct relationship to the Inc and Dec prices charged or paid to
those who inadvertently over- or under-schedule?  Please clarify that I
have understood this correctly.

Thanks a lot for your assistance.

Caroline

Subject:	487 Revelation

Steve,
	Here is a summary of what we have learned regarding how the CAISO is handling 487.  Kent at Sierra Power inquired to me why he was being charged 487, (487 is the charge code the CAISO uses when it has to go out of market, and purchase power that exceeds $150.00/mwh, 481 is the charge code they use to credit it back), for the same hours and intervals that both the INC and DEC prices were zero.  This was obviously very peculiar and nobody in VM knew the answer. So Caroline posed the question to Keoni at the CAISO.  His response was this:  that the CAISO is charging 487 regardless of the INC and DEC prices, to cover the forward market contracts signed by CDWR and CERS.  In effect, they are ignoring their tariff that states they are supposed to purchase power at the lowest price, and are in effect trying to recover costs for CDWR and CERS.

2.) In the Enpower Path Confirmation, we need to make cuts as Path Confirms. Enter comments in the confirmed section. We will be zeroing Enpower deals out on Monday (hint: NOTES are VERY important--All CUTS must be notated and the notes must be put in the accordion folders).

3.) Try to have the counterparties continue any paths around us. Just ""bow out"" gracefully if you have no other options with the words ""L - D's.""

4.) If we are cut by a generator/utility going into California, we must call the HA desk at California and tell them the increment that we will be underscheduling our load by. For example, EPE will be cutting all schedules going into California on light load (100 mws). If we cannot resupply the schedules we need to tell the state that we are underscheduling our load by 100 mws. THIS IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. We have posted an LC with Cali for this reason.

Also, EPE will be long RT 100 mws off-peak as they are no longer selling to us. 25 mws should be sold to TEP to cover a forward schedule. Stacy has set this up at PV. Please do this as a direct bill with EPE. As of Jan 01, 2002 we will no longer be marketing for EPE. Also, PV#3 will be coming off this weekend, and FC#4 will be down from HE 22 on Saturday through HE 06 on Sunday.

This will probably not be a fun weekend.

Thank you. This looks good. To answer some of your questions, price is per mw, not per deal. Transmission deals, EpmiCalPool deals, and sales or purchases from the counterparty California Imbalance in Enpower need to be excluded. 
Thanks,
Bill

Bill,

Here's an outline of what we talked about for the average price spreadsheet:

Pull deals for WHourly at Mid-Columbia, WSCC_N, NP15, SP15, and (Palo Verde +) WSCC_S
In a tabular format display:  Average price from the schedules for buys and sells for each hour in each region (i.e. Mid-Columbia, WSCC_N, etc.)

Underneath the table display:
On Peak average 
Off Peak average

for later:  (i.e. next version)
sort by groups:  24inc, EOL, EPEC

For clarification:
Average price is per MW not per deal?

I've asked Susmitha Nalluri to work on this for you.  She sits 2 desks down from me and works on the VMS team.  She has experience with spreadsheets, however she is not yet familiar with the EnPower view of the database.  I have given her a query to give her a jumpstart on pulling the data data you need from EnPower.  She and I have also met to go over where the data is being pulled from.  In my abscence she can go to Lei, Pete, Matt or David about questions regarding the EnPower Data.  I told her to feel free to ask you or Kate any questions.  I brought her down to meet you and Kate but did not realize you both (as well as most people) had left around lunchtime.

Kate,

I told her you would be bringing her more information on the Dow Jones sheet.  I forwarded Susmitha our earlier emails about it.

""it is commonly urged that, in a war between liberals and fanatics, the 
fanatics are sure to win, owing to their unshakable belief in the 
righteousness of their cause. this belief dies hard, although all history, 
including that of the last few years, is against it. fanatics have failed, 
over and over again, because they have attempted the impossible, or because, 
even when what was aimed at was possible, they were too unscientific to adopt 
the right means; they have failed also because they roused the hostility of 
those whom they wished to coerce. in every important war since 1700 the more 
democratic side has been victorious. this is partly because democracy and 
empiricism (which are intimately interconnected) do not demand a distortion of 
facts in the interests of theory. russia and canada, which have somewhat 
similar climactic conditions, are both interested in obtaining better breeds  
of wheat; in canada this aim is pursued experimentally, in russia by 
interpreting marxist scripture.
     ""systems of dogma without empirical foundation, such as those of 
scholastic theology, marxism, and fascism, have the advantage of producing a 
great degree of social coherence among their disciples. but they have the 
disadvantage of involving persecution of valuable sections of the population. 
spain was ruined by the expulsion of jews and moores; france suffered by the 
emigration of huguenots after the revocation of the edict of nantes; germany 
would probably have been the first in the field with the atomic bomb but for 
hitler's hatred of jews. and, to repeat, dogmatic systems have the two further 
disadvantages of involving false beliefs on practically important matters of 
fact, and rousing the violent hostility of those who do not share the 
fanaticism in question. for these various reasons, it is not to be expected 
that, in the long run, nations addicted to a dogmatic philosophy will have the 
advantage over those of a more empirical temper. nor is it true that dogma is 
necessary for social coherence when social coherence is called for; no nation 
could have shown more of it than the british showed in 1940.
     ""empiricism, finally, is to be commended not only on the ground of its 
greater truth, but also on ethical grounds. dogma demands authority, rather 
than intelligent thought, as the source of opinion; it requires persecution of 
heretics and hostility to unbelievers; it asks of its disciples that they 
should inhibit natural kindliness in favor of systematic hatred. since 
argument is not recognized as a means of arriving at the truth, adherents of 
rival dogmas have no method except war by means of which to reach a decision. 
and war, in our scientific age, means, sooner or later, universal death.
     ""i conclude that, in our day as in the time of locke, empiricist 
liberalism (which is not incompatible with democratic socialism) is the only 
philosophy that can be adopted by a man who, on the one hand demands some 
scientific evidence for his beliefs, and, on the other hand, desires human 
happiness more than the prevalence of this or that party or creed. our 
confused and difficult world needs various things if it is to escape disaster, 
and among these, one of the most necessary is that, in the nations which still 
uphold liberal beliefs, these beliefs should be wholehearted and profound, not 
apologetic towards dogmatisms of the right and of the left, but deeply 
persuaded of the value of liberty, scientific freedom, and mutual forbearance. 
for without these beliefs, life on our politically divided but technically 
unified planet will hardly continue to be possible.""

SC Settlement Contacts:
IMPORTANT NOTICE
Draft Statement File Specification (V13.1)


ISO plans to make some minor changes to the Settlement Statement Files
related to ""Soft Price Cap for  Ancillary Services"", described as follows:

Soft Price Cap for  Ancillary Services

Problem Description
Last December, ISO implemented the Soft Price Cap scheme that established a
soft price cap for both energy and Ancillary Services (A/S).  Bids above the
soft cap, if accepted, would be paid as bid (subject to review and refund),
but would not be able to set the Market Clearing Price (MCP).  The soft cap
was set to $250 initially and then changed to $150 in January.  In the
subsequent FERC Orders dated 4/25 and 6/19, FERC has established new price
mitigation schemes.  However, the underlying mechanism of the soft price cap
scheme has remained the very much similar.  The only difference is that the
soft cap becomes a more dynamic number under the more recent schemes.
The soft price cap for energy is processed automatically by ISO's Settlement
System.  For A/S, a manual process is being used.  When an A/S bid at above
the mitigated price cap is accepted, it receives two payments: one at MCP
and another that accounts for the difference between the bid price and MCP.
Currently, this surplus payment is calculated manually and appears as a
manual adjustment in the SC's statement file.  The corresponding allocation
of such surplus payments to the market also appears as manual adjustments in
the other SCs' statement files.  The manual process is labor intensive, more
prone to error and creates a large number of manual adjustments that are
difficult to track.


Proposed Solution

ISO plans to automate A/S Soft Price Cap scheme.  Once automated, the
accepted A/S bids will receive only one payment whose price is the higher of
the bid price and Market Clearing Price.  No manual adjustments will be
needed.  The entire payment will appear in the Day Ahead Ancillary Services
Due SC payments (charge types 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6) or Hour Ahead Ancillary
Services Due SC payments (charge types 51, 52, 54, 55 and 56).

The Ancillary Services cost allocation (charge types 111,112,114,115 and
116) will be calculated using a weighed average prices for the service
instead of the MCPs.

Settlement Calculations

For Day Ahead (DA) A/S Due SC payments, the price will be given by:
Price = max (Bid Price, DA Zonal MCP of given service)

Similarly, for Hour Ahead (HA) A/S Due SC payments,
Price = max (Bid Price, HA Zonal MCP of given service)

For A/S Cost Allocation, the unit price of A/S obligation is currently
determined as follows:
Allocation Price = (DAQ*DAMCP + HAQ*HAMCP) / (DAQ + HAQ)
where
DAQ = DA procurement target in the subject DA Region
HAQ = Incremental HA procurement target in the zones that make up the DA
region
DAMCP = MCP of the subject service in the DA region
HAMCP = Weighted average MCP of the subject service in the zones that make
up the DA region

Under the new scheme, the MCP terms in the above equation will be replaced
by average procurement costs.  Thus,
Allocation Price = (DAQ*DAP + HAQ*HAP) / (DAQ + HAQ)
where
DAP = Average procurement price of the subject service in the DA region
HAP = Average procurement price of the subject service in the zones that
make up the DA region

Settlement Statements

There is no change to the settlement files structure.  The meaning of
several fields in the Ancillary Services Detail File have been modified
slightly.  These changes are explained in the latest draft of the ISO
Settlement Statement Files Specification - Version 13.1.



Implementation Timelines

The change described above will take place in the Settlement Statements
beginning with trade date 5/29/2001, on which the FERC price mitigation
scheme (as described in the FERC 4/25 Order) took effect.

Ryan sent this email out once already, here it is again.  The oasis site map is http://www.nwoasis.org/OASIS/NODE
The details of checking for ATC are as such Red=PAC(t), Blue=IPC(t)

Leg 1. PACW to ENPR
Leg 2. ENPR to BOBR
Leg 3. BOBR to PATHC
Leg 4. PATHC to PACE
Leg 5. PACE to FC3

We can do a buy resell with EPE to move this to PV or can use APS tranny to move this to Mead or PV as well.
When scheduling from BOBR to FC3 on PAC (t) be sure to just put in the POR/POD and do NOT schedule each wheel seperately.  This will prevent us from being charged $5.84 each time.  Total cost for this tranny should be $5.84 +$2.38 +$5.84 = $14.06.  There will also be losses.  If using this wheel for a services customer, be sure to add in for losses and scheduling fees.  Also, be sure to LOG OUT of the IPC website when finished, otherwise we will be locked out if we time out!  There should already be a template for a tag to move this energy from PAC system border in the NW to FC345.  This path has had approximately 400 mws of tranny availabe the last few days.
Please see me with questions.

As the southwest heats up, or the ISO goes into stages of emergency, or path 15 is congested north to south we will want to get power from the northwest utilities down to APS and so on in the southwest.  We can do this many ways but one that I have discovered that may have much capacity is as follows.

1.  NW Utility to PAC on BPA(T)
2.  PACW to IPC(T)@Enterprise(ENPR) on PAC(T)
3.  IPC@ENPR to PAC(T)@Borah Brady(BOBR) on IPC(T)
4.  IPC@BOBR to Four Corners(FC3) on PAC(T)
5.  Sink with anyone at four corners or buy tranny over to palo or mead.

I'm not sure how long there is going to be room but for monday there is 400mw of room on this path.

FYI -

I left a message with Rich Brueger @ MPC regarding power we resupplied at Montana System on 8/1, HE 13. I'm giving you the same information I left with him in case any questions arise in my absence. Fortunately, there is a detailed cut note in the Lotus database, so you can refer to that if I've missed the mark entirely. Out of Montana's 62 mw of choice customer load that hour, we resupplied 41 mw. Following is the breakdown of sink counterparties:

Luzenac America, Inc. - 5 mw
Smurfit-Stone Container Corp. - 25 mw
Express Pipeline Partnership - 6 mw
Cenex Harvest States Coop. - 5 mw

Deals entered real time to resupply are 714148 (Buy PGE @ Mid-C) and 714150 (BPA tranny Mid-C to Montana System).

Dear Mr. Williams:

I am contacting you at the suggestion of Hollie Krebs.  I would like to arrange a brief meeting in which I could obtain your expert advice and insight on your company and the industry in which you operate.

I am in the networking phase of searching for a new career opportunity.  Hollie and I discussed some aspects of her career as a marketer of utilities.  She mentioned that, with my background, your industry would be excellent to evaluate.  Hollie spoke very highly of you and your company.  She thought that I would learn a great deal from your expertise.

Please understand that I am not expecting you to know of a job opening nor am I asking you to help me find one.  I believe your guidance will help me to further develop my career strategy.  I am enclosing my resume for you to critique. Please be candid with any advice and/or ideas that you may have.

During the last eleven years, I worked as General Manager of Sunset Office Outfitters and Office Manager of Chemcentral Corporation-Portland.  The president of Sunset recruited me to help turn around his business. My primary responsibilities at Sunset Office were to correct serious personnel and financial problems, create policies and procedures to allow the company to refocus on marketing.  Chemcentral is a large, international chemical distributor.  My duties as Office Manager were to generate and analyze financial statements, manage personnel issues, create and monitor company policies and procedures.  Both companies provided great learning experiences for me.  My combined administrative and sales experience should prove very beneficial in my next position.

I realize your time is very valuable.  You mentioned that you will call me today around 3:00 p.m.  I would like to arrange a brief appointment at a time that is convenient for you.  My questions deal primarily with your education, career path and your opinion on what career(s) I should be pursuing.  I will talk to you soon and thank you for your time.

These guys filed a bunch of complaints against Sempra too, back when Sempra owned the plant.---sch

Duke's Calif Whistleblowers Have History Of Grievances  Updated: Wednesday, June 27, 2001 07:36 PM ET 
By Jason Leopold 
Of DOW JONES NEWSWIRES 
LOS ANGELES (Dow Jones)--Three former employees who last week told California lawmakers Duke Energy (DUK </investments/quotes/?symbol=DUK>, news </investments/news/?symbol=DUK>, msgs </investments/discuss/?symbol=DUK>) ramped down its South Bay power plant when supplies were tight filed a total of 34 complaints while they were still working at the plant, including allegations of harassment and racial discrimination, the men told Dow Jones Newswires. 
Most of the grievances were filed between 1999 and 2001 against the plant's previous owner, Sempra Energy (SRE </investments/quotes/?symbol=SRE>, news </investments/news/?symbol=SRE>, msgs </investments/discuss/?symbol=SRE>) unit San Diego Gas & Electric, for which the men continued to work while Duke controlled the plant. But interviews with the three men also revealed a dissatisfaction with Duke's profit-centered management style in the deregulated market. 
Duke has called the employees' allegations about its operating procedures ""baseless."" Duke has said the employees have an ""ax to grind,"" because they weren't hired by the company in April when escrow on the power plant closed and Duke acquired some of SDG&E's workforce. 
The men are the first to come forward publicly and testify against their employers, who are locked in a high-stakes struggle with the state of California over allegations of price gouging. The state is pursuing billions of dollars in refunds from power producers and hopes to bring criminal charges against their executives. 
Glenn Johnson, 52, a mechanic at the South Bay power plant, alone filed 30 complaints. On one occasion, Johnson said he called the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health, because an unqualified employee was found scraping up asbestos. He also has a harassment complaint against SDG&E regarding an employee who now works for Duke, but Johnson said his lawyer told him not to discuss it. 
Aside from the formal complaints, Johnson said under the Duke regime he was disciplined for taking too much sick time after being out for 10 months for cancer treatment. 
""This is just the kind of abuse we had to endure ever since this became a business,"" he said. 
One of the other employees, Jim Olkjer, 56, a former assistant control room operator at the power plant, filed three complaints against SDG&E while Duke operated the plant, because his evaluations consistently said he needed supervision. The grievances were either turned down or settled, he said. 
Olkjer said he decided to testify against Duke after he learned he wouldn't be hired by the energy company when it took over plant operations in April. 
""I'm on a fixed income now,"" Olkjer said in an interview. ""I can't afford my utility bills on a fixed income."" 
The third employee, Ed Edwards, 42, a certified power plant mechanic, said he filed one complaint against three SDG&E employees in 1999 for racial discrimination. One of the employees was hired by Duke. That case is still pending. 
Edwards, an African-American, said Duke didn't hire qualified minority employees after it took over the plant and instead hired less-qualified white employees. Edwards said the two minority supervisors that worked at the plant under SDG&E were replaced with white employees when Duke took over. 
Edwards, who stopped working at the plant in February, said he decided to testify against Duke after receiving a phone call from Johnson. 
""I knew I wouldn't be hired,"" he said. 
Edwards and Johnson filed charges of harassment and racial discrimination against SDG&E with the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. 
SDG&E spokesman Art Larson wouldn't comment on the allegations. Duke spokesman Tom Williams said the company stands by its hiring practices and ""always hires the most qualified employees."" 
In 1999, Duke settled a 1996 discrimination claim with the U.S. Department of Labor for $769,700, in which the department found some areas where white females and black males were paid less than white male and black female counterparts in similar positions. 
Dissatisfaction With New Priorities 
The former employees said they weren't motivated to blow the whistle on Duke by the prospects of cashing in on a possible settlement with the state. Johnson first alerted the media about Duke's behavior before state Attorney General Bill Lockyer mentioned financial rewards for whistleblowers. 
The employees each earned about $1,000 a week. 
All three employees said they believe Duke mismanaged the South Bay power plant by ramping the units up and down, tossing out spare parts, and operating machinery when it was broken. Olkjer said he saw the plant's output reduced during the worst power emergencies ""at least 50 times."" 
When Edwards questioned his supervisors about the behavior he said they told him, ""It's none of your business."" 
The employees said that Duke was more concerned with making money than the happiness of its staff, and that the company tried to bust its union contract when it first took over the plant. 
""I was paid to twist wrenches,"" Johnson said. ""The last raise I got two years ago was 2.25%. That's an insult to my skill."" 
Duke said it is bringing the former SDG&E employees under its contract with International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers Local 1245. The workers were previously represented by another local, and Duke wanted a single contract. 
Johnson said he decided to blow the whistle on Duke because he was disgusted by the company's ""gluttony and greed."" He said he stole the control room logs in February after a colleague pointed out to him that Duke was reducing output at the plant. 
Johnson, Edwards and Olkjer said ""in the old days"" the power plant ran at full throttle and never ramped up or down. But as soon as deregulation became law in the state, things started to change. SDG&E would also vary the plant's output, but not as dramatically as Duke did, they said. 
""To the best of my recollection, we had years of being extremely reliable and being on line all the time,"" Edwards said. ""Once Duke took the reins, that changed. We were no longer a family."" 
Duke has said that it adjusted the plant's output to meet its contractual commitments and to respond to the directions of the California Independent System Operator, manager of the state's power grid. 
The ISO frequently directed plants to ramp output up and down to meet changing requirements on the grid, and the employees who testified weren't in a position to know the whole picture, said Bill Hall, vice president of Duke's western operations. 
Duke spokesman Tom Williams said the company plans to release data showing the ISO ordered the plant to ramp up and down Jan. 16-18, the period cited from the control-room logs, to keep supply in balance. A copy of the ISO control-room logs obtained by Dow Jones Newswires shows that the ISO did make such orders during a Stage 3 emergency, because it didn't need Duke's capacity, which it thought too expensive.

	Top Financial News    10/29 11:09 Enron Credit Rating Cut by Moody's; CP Rating on Review By Mark Pittman  New York, Oct. 29 (Bloomberg) -- Enron Corp.'s credit rating was cut by Moody's Investors Service after the largest energy trader's shares fell by almost half last week. Moody's also said it may downgrade Enron's commercial-paper rating.  Enron reported $1.01 billion in losses this month from investments outside its business of trading commodities such as electricity and natural gas. Chief Financial Officer Andrew Fastow quit as the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission asked for information about transactions he conducted for partnerships he headed.  Moody's lowered the senior unsecured long-term debt ratings of Enron from ``Baa1'' to ``Baa2.'' The ratings company said they may be lowered further. Moody's placed the company's ``P-2'' rating for commercial paper on review for downgrade. Moody's placed Enron's long-term debt ratings on review on Oct. 16.  Moody's rates Enron's unsecured debt as ``Baa1,'' the third- lowest investment grade.  Enron's long-term credit ratings outlook was changed last week to negative from stable by Standard & Poor's. S&P affirmed the Houston-based company's rating of ``BBB+'' which is investment grade.  Shares of Enron fell as much as $1.85, or 12 percent, to $13.55.    <http://bloomberg.tveyes.com/>  <http://bloomberg.tveyes.com/>

Good Afternoon FSP users,

We have just finished a comprehensive FSP rebuild & testing phase for the next release of FSP.  The rebuild should address all the issues raised in the previous go-live as well as some additional capabilities for robustness.  Please note that we have already executed several hundred different test case scenarios & performed some stress testing using data before the Enron collapse.

What we need now is help from you to continue to identify enhancements and/or bugs with FSP so that we can go-live with FSP once the new company starts trading.  Susan Amador will be available to help in any testing.  You should probably also coordinate with her when you are about to start testing so that our continuing testing doesn't interfere with your testing.  PWRTESTN & PWRTESTP should be all setup for your use.

Here are some of the bug fixes & enhancements we have rolled-out with this latest release:
1.  Bid Curve - Ability to bid on zero volumes (for import, export, and wheels)
2.  Rebuild of all FSP application utilizing Direct Oracle Access components for faster database access & higher reliability.
3.  Bug Fixes on database commits to eliminate database ""deadlocks"".
4.  New aggregation scout to ""stream-line"" the template writing process & improve template writing performance.
5.  SQL tuned ""Hour Ahead"" template writing.  Confirmed performance of 1min 30 seconds on heavy transaction volume days.
6.  And many other small previously unidentified bugs.

We are very excited about this newest release and are looking forward to your feedback over the next couple of days.  Susan will probably be your best contact but please feel free to contact me at anytime.

Thanks,  David Poston

 Bill,  thanks for the visit we enjoyed it.  It is always helpful to talk
face to face and have some frank discussion regarding   our current
business relationship.  Hopefully, we'll be able to reciprocate with a
visit in the near future.

On a different matter, I was going over some recent historical data and
have come across some instances where I believe we have room to displace
gas-fired generation with inexpensive purchased power.  In order to do
this, we need to tighten up our real-time operations.  By this, I mean to
start putting all our gas-fired generation down to their minimums and
replacing it with purchased power (this would apply to the early morning
hours only, since we have some take or pay gas we still have to burn some
base gas but this can be done during the day when prices are higher and our
loss will be less).

For example,  Thursday October 18, the unit commitment called for purchases
of around 330 MW during the early hours (see attached unit commitment for
amounts and times).  We only purchased 130 MW net during this time frame.
So we ended up generating around 200 mwh at around $44/mwh when purchase
power  was available for $19/mwh.  Furthermore, there was a sale for HE
06:00 to ENRON/CAISO for $22/mwh.  When we enter this sale into our costing
model, the sale will result in a loss of approximately $1,000 for EPE Power
Marketing since the model will use marginal cost (gas-fired generation) to
cost this sale.

Please look into this matter and  call me if you have any questions or wish
to discuss it further.

I have been approached by 3 different groups regarding an HA or RT index in the West. I have decided against participating with TraderNews or PowerDex. I am considering participating with Dow Jones. I think a working index would help encourage liquidity through price discovery in real time. It should also provide an index to settle against financially for our desk and the Cash desks. I am working with Kate and our developement group upstairs to get the tools in place to participate in the Dow Jones index. I am still waiting for the confidentiality agreements from DJ and will be sending them to Steve Hall when they arrive.

Mike ,as we have discussed several times Amec will perform the work based on trhe rate schedules provided ton date with a lump sum based on the estimated hours times these rates.This does not mean we will provide the profit/overhead /bare wage breakdowns as described herein.We also said we would execute work in overrun at 60% of the scedule rates.This is what was discussed and written into the latest documents we reviewed last Friday.I am available in Toronto for awhile this a.m. at 905-8295400 ext.2489 if we need to discuss again.

In order to further clarify our understanding of how the payment 
mechanism would work in the exhibits of the PSA, I am attaching a 
summary of the preferred method for compensation under the Pre-NTP and 
NTP phases of the PSA's.  In particular, on the NTP Lump Sum price 
determination, we would prefer to see the breakdown of manhours in the 
format previously transmitted (by task by month), and by Engineering 
Discipline.  The Canadian rate structure you provided had about 15 or 
more categories of Engineering Disciplines, and this should be used to 
reflect the all-in hourly rates times the manhours in each category 
which will equate to the estimated Lump Sum price noted in the 
attachment.  

Your organization chart reflects all personnel in Vancouver being 
assigned to the project team, except the Customer Sponsor.  We would not 
expect to have to pay for the sponsor's cost, nor any travel time for 
personnel to/from Atlanta. 

We are getting clarification from LED if the actual driving of the test 
piles will be included in your deliverables or will be done directly by 
LED during the Oct 1-31 period.  Will advise.

Jim & Darren -

It looks as though the only ISO true-up information Risk received was regarding our July variance of $86,743. This does not take into account the August variances totalling approx. $42,000 in revenue we did not receive throughout the month. Fran has informed me that as soon as she has this information she can account for the credit to the Short Term West Hourly book; but as you can see by the attached e-mail, Risk has only accounted for July variances, not August, in this PMA. 

I did go over the Month End Variance report Jim gave me, and I have some questions about the totals listed in it - in particular having to do with charges 253, 405, 111, and 112. Let me know when one or both of you has a moment and I think we can clear this up.

Again, I think the only variances we still have out there for the WHOURLY book are the four that occurred in August, which are as follows:

8/11 - $990
8/16 - $37,787.25
8/18 - ($6,764.68)	
8/22 - $9.495.25

As long as we're all aware of the ISO charges and revenue still unaccounted for - and know they will be in the future - I think we can all sleep soundly. Let me know if you have any questions on this.

Thanks,
Kate

Kate:

Per your request I have double checked Risk's daily record on ISO revenue/expenses for WHOURLY book in August and everything checked out.  Here is the result:

Daily ISO revenue/expenses total (8/1-8/31)	+$629,709 (you can also get this number by adding up the ISO report Risk 							distributed to you every morning along with your P&L )
July ISO true up					+$86,743 
=>					total	+$716,452
Month-end August ISO revenue/expenses 	+$716,481 (we got this total from Volume Mgmt)
Variance (i.e. true-up)				+$29

I have communicated this with Volume Management with the above results.  Jim advised that they might have added some items ""after fact"" during August but those changes were neither included in the daily ISO flash Risk got nor included in the month-end flash, and that's probably why you are expecting more than what Risk gave you.  Jim and Darren will be looking into their records in order to check out with you.

Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks,
Fran

Here is the most current information regarding charges from the CAISO, the FERC Ruling and the Price Cap.

1.  The current price cap is $91.87.  We should continue our practice of not selling over the cap, however we can (and should) buy over the cap if necessary for the system reliability of our service customers.

2.  The FERC order specifies a penalty of $100 per mw for underscheduling load (greater than 5% per load zone underscheduled).  Despite the CAISO's repeated protests (and the IOU's complete disregard of this order), WE can expect to be subject to this penalty.

3.  When a WARNING is in effect the CAISO will be making out-of -market calls.  These OOM calls will not show up in the expost or beep stack.  Therefore when power supplies become tight, the prices in the ""expost"" may actually drop.  We should continue our practice of NOT leaving uninstructed energy in the CAISO whenever possible.

4.  We should continue to participate in the CAISO congestion market.  The CAISO frequently has unexpected hourly path loadings, and congestion has occurred in the hour ahead market that was not present in the day ahead market.

5.  Remember to include CAISO export fees, Tie Meter Multipliers/import fees and grid management fees in your CAISO calculations of wheeling charges.



We will have a real-time meeting on Monday July 9th at 4:30 PM in Mt. Hood.  We will discuss other changes in the market at that time.  Please make plans to attend.
Thank you,
Bill"

I have copied in a note from Roger at EPE. As you can see they are placing a VERY high importance on economic dispatch of the units. Please be aware that every move with regards to marketing and running their system is under EXTREME scrutiny.

Please call me before you call our customer.

Thanks,

Correction:
The burner problem is on Newman 3.  (Thank You! Mr Ward)   The unit will be held at 85 MW's until repairs can be made.  The plan is to assess the problem Monday morning and make the necessary repairs.    

If prices continue to be below cost we need to purchase power and back down
local units.  With Copper off, the dispatch shows we need to purchase power for 5 or 6 hours through super peak. 

Depending on load,  GT 1 and GT 2 should be put in the hole (around 7 to 10
MW's each) HE 1:00 through HE 9:00...

If  Market conditions are less than $14.00  BACK DOWN Four Corners...   As
load picks up be sure to pick up Four Corners first!
If there is a reason we have to dump FC power please send me a note!   If
there is any confusion over whether to back down FC CALL.

Any questions or comments please call at  5808  or  915-204-1202...

We are starting to see some market changes as we transition into the winter months.

First:
With EPE we will start seeing a severe morning ramp. We will have to carefully manage the units to prevent ""swinging"" them and increasing the chance of a unit outage. As the EPE loads plummet off-peak, we should consult the unit commitment, and depending on market conditions look to take units off-line and/ or put units on manual and buy energy back. Recently we have sold energy from EPE at a loss rather than putting costly gas turbines on manual (Newman 1, 2 and 3), reducing them, and buying that energy less expensively in the market. Our relationship with EPE is at a critical stage, they have a new vice-president and will be hiring new management to lead their marketing group. We would like to be a part of EPE's marketing effort going forward, but need to continue to prove that our level of service cannot be matched either in-house or by other marketers. I look to each member of the group to be a part of this effort and to work closely to run the EPE grid as efficiently as possible.

Second:
The morning ramp will soon be upon us in the Northwest. It will become very difficult to get energy in the Nortwest for HE 6 through HE 10. We should look for congestion possibly on the COI and the DC. Also, as lights and heaters come on in the evening, there should be another jump in load at HE 18 through HE 20. Enron Calgary will also be looking for energy these hours. Be sure to take this load movement into consideration if you lock a price in with ECC.

Finally:
We will have a meeting on TUESDAY--November 6th at 4:30 in the afternoon--(the first Tuesday as usual) to discuss market changes, peformance reviews and the final two months of the year.

Please see me with any questions regarding the system.

Thank you.

Bill

Bill -

Could you take a look at what I've put together? Conceivably, this spreadsheet would link to a web page that we (or I) could maintain, which would include a WSCC map with hot buttons in or near the areas we trade that would give traders the most recent weather information. I talked to Cara about setting up an intranet site, as she had previously mentioned wanting us to do that, and she said she was working on setting something up with Fundamentals and Volume Management. That's a whole different subject - maybe we could chat about that briefly if you get a free moment. At any rate, this is a rough draft, but I thought I'd show it to you to make sure I'm heading in the right direction.

From an information standpoint this looks good. I would recommend using an appendix for the WSCC members, the FERC ruling, the NERC glossary and any other lengthy terms or charts. You might look to organize the paper from a broad overview of the electrical market in the west (including basic descriptions, timelines, fundamentals, etc.) down to a specific description of what you did at Enron. The content of the paper looks good and I am comfortable with you submitting what you have.
If you need any thing else regarding your paper just let me know.
 
Thanks,
Bill

For those on night and day shift on Saturday/Sunday the emergency back-up generators will be tested. The testing will occur from 5 AM to 10 AM on Sunday morning. Dave Steiner has assured me that RT will be unaffected and Dave will be on hand to help if anything is needed. I think we should work to have everything submitted early to the CISO, tags made, etc. At least for HE 6, HE 7 and HE 8.

Importance:	High

Please be advised that:

A counterparty that wants to terminate a contract needs to send a letter of termination via fax to (713) 646-3227
	           The termination letter needs to include:
		1.) List of contracts being terminated
		2.) Calculation of termination payment
		3.) Expectation of payments if applicable
  
A counterparty that unwinds deals does not mean a contract its null and void; the counterparty is still liable for the existing deals governed by the contract

Please forward this on to anyone who needs this information.

Thanks,

Susan

Samuel -

Thanks for completing that request so quickly. Unfortunately, I received a message from Todd Bland over the weekend saying he is still unable to save deals using his own name. He called Enpower support and spoke with Nicolay, who told Todd he needed an Originator ID - are you familiar with that or how Todd could get one? Also, we have one more trader who never received access to trade under these desks: Short Term West BOM, Short Term Southwest, Short Term California. His name is Steve Merriss. Could you please add his name to the list as well?

Thanks again for all of your help.

Group,

We are lending from El Paso Electric on Monday. We have sold 15 mws for HE 7-22 to ST-SW at $62.50.  We are paying El Paso $4 for the service to lend from their system.   The sell to ST-SW is under the ST-WBOM book (#696314), the purchase from EPE is also under the WBOM book (deal #696315-note the price will be changed to $4 on Monday from $56).  Please buy energy to cover this 15 mw short on Monday under the ST-WBOM book and sell to EPE at $0 under the ST-WBOM book.  The deal is physically prescheduled going out from EPE.  We need to schedule the 15 mw going to EPE.  Please do NOT buy from EPE in the morning even though they may be fat.  We are hoping to do more lending with EPE going forward and therefore need to make this as easy as possible for their dispatchers (do not bring up lending to them-it will lead to unnecessary confusion).  If you have any questions concerning this procedure please call me. 503-887-3449 (c) or 503-274-0502 (h).

Good Afternoon,

I am pleased to announce that we have finally completed the 10 day parallel test milestone for FSP.  We were also seeing solid performance for our key metrics during the parallel (template writing 1:30 - 2:30, finals processing 5-7 minutes).  Lastly, based on my understanding of our go-live bet, my total debt owed to Tim Belden = $13.00.  Tim, I gave the money to Debra.

What Next?

User Training
I will be working with the DA & Real time guys to make sure everyone is up-to-speed with the new system.  We are also in the process of developing some user documentation cheat sheets to help in the transition.

Production Parallel
We have already begun using FSP in parallel in production by writing templates in FSP & comparing them to CAPS.  We will continue doing this until we are getting consistent results between the two systems.  This production parallel has necessitated some changes to the existing Enpower_to_CAPS report that we have already started modifying.

How long? 

Once bit, twice shy.  No money on this one, but I don't think it should take over a week to train the users.  The production parallel may take a little longer.  I am really relying on the users to wrap this one up.  Kysa Alport has already volunteered for this duty and I spent a good part of today training her.  

Thanks,  David Poston  "

I would like to sit down and discuss the $5.00/MW charge that is being associated to each EES transaction.  Since Tim Coffing is now up here and managing our intra-month portfolio, I feel the ability to manage a retail position is better than what it was and the volatility in the wholesale market has come off quite a bit.  I would like to discuss this further with you sometime today.

How was Austin?  Did you get the rest and relaxation you were looking for?  How about golf?  Everyone has only ever had good things to say about Austin.

Audi TT?
NICE pick.  Is that a 6-speed?  Only 23,000 miles is pretty sweet and the color is right (matches the 400E).  Next time I am down there (?) you'll have to provide a demonstration.  I am really getting the urge to lose my 525 (this seems to happen about every 6 months), I have only driven it once since I moved (about 5 miles total).  Kind of hard to justify $+500 a month for car, insurance and parking when I drive it 20 miles in a month (just not very cost effective).  An old 2002tii would only cost me parking and insurance (and my pride).  Other ideas?

So I am in the new place.  It's great!  Perfect location (just no parking), and I get way more sleep (til 5!).  Its got a pretty solid view and feels much bigger than it is because of all the windows.  Now if I could just get some furniture...maybe a table...

There are several new computer viruses that are spreading rapidly on the internet.  The viruses target Windows computer users and arrives in e-mails with various subject lines like ""Fwd:Peace BeTweeN AmeriCa and IsLaM!"" The messages also contain attachments that can be directly executed by clicking on the attachment.  The most prevalent virus has an attachment named wtc.exe. 

If you ever get an email with an attachment that has an executable file, you should never launch the attachment.  At Enron, these file types are blocked automatically from entering our environment.  However, if you would connect to an external email service (i.e. Hotmail, AOL, Yahoo, etc) while using an Enron computer or attached to the Enron network, you could infect our internal computing systems.  If you do, the virus could cause significant issues and prevent some of our systems from working effectively.

If you ever get an email that you are not sure about, simply delete the email and contact your resolution center to let them know how you obtained the message.  It is much better to be safe than sorry as we will be able to track down the origin of the virus in the Enron Network.

Increasingly, plants put grid at risk
POTENTIAL FOR OUTAGES 
: OPERATORS REFUSE
STATE'S REQUESTS TO ADJUST POWER LEVELS 
BY STEVE JOHNSON <mailto:sjohnson@sjmercury.com>
Mercury News 
More than a month after two generators refused state orders to deliver power as promised and triggered a near-meltdown of the Western power grid, California's electrical system continues to be hindered by a growing and potentially dangerous anarchy. 
Officials with the California Independent System Operator say power-plant operators increasingly are refusing the state's directions to adjust their plant power levels up or down to keep the electrical system in balance. Nearly one-fourth of the orders were ignored in July and August, state officials say. 
Refusals have increased steadily from about nine a day in May to more than 160 a day in August. The most serious incident occurred Aug. 2, when two power-plant operators declined to provide the power they promised. That resulted in what authorities called a major frequency drop across the West, with the potential to cause blackouts. 
Concern grows 
Although no outages have been caused so far, Stephanie McCorkle, a spokeswoman for the Independent System Operator, said state officials are deeply concerned. 
``Our operators need a certain amount of certainty when you're running a grid,'' McCorkle said. Unfortunately, ``the level of uncertainty has reached an uncomfortable level for ISO operators.'' 
Why this is happening remains unclear, according to California and power company officials. Jan Smutny-Jones, the ISO's former chairman who heads the Independent Energy Producers Association, which represents generators, said, ``It's very hard to tell'' because a number of factors appear to be at work. 
He and McCorkle agreed that the refusal to follow orders partly stems from a growing frustration by generators over not being paid for power they have supplied the state. In recent weeks, generators have gotten only about 8 cents on the dollar, McCorkle said, noting that the problem largely stems from payments coming late from the California Department of Water Resources, which has been buying power for the state's financially strapped utilities. 
Generators frustrated 
Gary Ackerman, executive director of the Western Power Trading Forum, also blamed the state's new portfolio of long-term power contracts. 
He believes state officials may be forcing those large blocks of contracted electricity onto the grid, to avoid admitting that they bought more than they needed. But inserting those blocks into the system can be complicated, Ackerman said, and often requires difficult-to-make adjustments by other power-plant operators to keep the grid stable. 
Moreover, Ackerman said, the state has been relying increasingly on a computerized system that sends instructions to plant operators when power levels need to be raised or lowered. However, he said, that system can't handle the number of instructions the state is sending. 
``It's like pushing your car from zero to 120 and back to zero, and doing that over and over,'' Ackerman said. ``Your car just wasn't designed to do that.'' 
ISO officials acknowledged that fitting the long-term contracts into the system has been tough. But despite some minor glitches with the computer system, they said, they did not believe it was responsible for generators not doing what they've been told. 
No fines yet 
So far, no generators have been fined for disobeying orders, said Charles Robinson, the ISO's chief counsel. He noted, however, that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, which is investigating the matter, could decide that fines are warranted. 
But because California is so dependent on generators for its electricity, authorities have to be careful not to alienate power plant operators by penalizing them too harshly, said Mark Ward of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. 
``How do you motivate people to do the right thing?'' Ward asked. ``It's not a real simple problem.''

Chaos,Inexperience Hobbled Power Buyers
State electricity purchasers often finished second against veteran industry traders.
By DARYL KELLEY and JEFFREY L. RABIN
Times Staff Writers

August 12 2001

It was the night before the darkest day of the winter energy crisis, when California's first wave of rolling blackouts paralyzed cities from Bakersfield to Eureka.

Davis administration strategists were huddled in a Sacramento office that January evening, trying to figure how to keep the lights on, when a speeding tractor-trailer slammed into the Capitol like a runaway train.

""I looked out the window and saw the flames and the smoke rising,"" said Ray Hart, head of the energy planning team. The symbolism was not lost on him.

The next day, with the state's electricity supply on the line and the governor's political career on the blink, Hart was called on to create an organization that overnight would become the biggest power buyer in the West, purchasing electricity for 10 million customers whose utilities were going broke.

Now, seven months and billions of dollars later, the administration is under fire for paying top dollar for a cadre of inexperienced traders who at times have been exploited by veterans in the cutthroat energy industry. Even Gov. Gray Davis acknowledges the mismatch.

""It's like the Yankees playing a stickball team,"" he said in a recent interview. ""We're totally out of our league.""

The administration's new long-term contracts also have been criticized for paying too much for power that may not be needed in the future.

Making matters worse, nearly a dozen consultants hired by the administration owned stock in energy companies--a fact revealed only after they were belatedly asked to file personal financial statements. Five were hastily fired, and the federal government is investigating possible insider trading violations.

""How an agency could forget conflict-of-interest codes, or ignore them, is beyond me,"" said Doug Heller of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights in Santa Monica. ""This is the way people lose faith in government.""

Hart said it never occurred to him that consultants and buyers in his vastly broadened organization should file declarations of financial interest until requests for the information rolled in, including one from Davis' Republican political rival, Secretary of State Bill Jones.

Amid all the controversy of recent days, Hart said, the efforts of his staff in helping to avoid blackouts so far this summer have been overshadowed.

""Frankly,"" said Hart, a veteran administrator with the state Department of Water Resources, ""it's kind of disconcerting we aren't getting the credit we should be getting.""

Patching Together a Team on the Fly

The state's new energy-buying organization was a beg, borrow and recruit operation. A core group already was working in the Department of Water Resources to buy power for the massive canal pumps of the State Water Project.

The agency received an immediate infusion of $22 million to create its expanded trading arm of 88 employees and consultants.

On the fly, Hart patched together a team of retired state energy buyers, workers from a closed energy exchange and analysts from Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison and the energy industry.

Many were hired to buy electricity on the spot market after repeatedly calling power companies throughout the West to negotiate prices. Then they needed to schedule its use on a statewide monitoring system that reflects supply and demand.

From the start, the administration said it would pay higher wages than usual to attract talented traders who could hold their own against wily veterans at private energy marketing firms.

""Energy trading and purchasing is a very complex business with millions of dollars of energy purchased every day,"" a state budget document said. ""It is important to recognize the level of risk and the high level of expertise that is necessary to effectively manage that risk and operate the program effectively. Professionals in this business are highly compensated.""

Power buyer William Mead was among the first to get the call in early February.

""They said, 'Can you be up here Tuesday?' "" said Mead, a 55-year-old former Edison engineer from Duarte. ""I said, 'For a job interview?' And they said, 'No, bring enough stuff for several months.' ""

They told him to bring his last paycheck and a resume, Mead said. He worked six weeks, he said, before he finally got a contract to sign.

""In those early days it was chaos because we were always at Stage 2, on the verge of blackouts,"" he said. ""There was no focus other than to keep the lights on."" One day, Mead said, he bought 10% of all power consumed on the state's electricity grid during his 12-hour shift.

But, unlike Mead, most of the new crew had never bought power before, according to their resumes. Most worked at the now-defunct California Power Exchange, an energy trading floor similar to a stock market, reconciling sales and purchases made by others. Before that, one worked at a freight-forwarding company in Carson and another ran China Noodle House in Arcadia.

Energy industry insiders said they have spotted a series of rookie moves by the new group.

""They're just buying too much or buying too little or buying too much too fast,"" said Mark Palmer, spokesman for Houston-based Enron Corp., one of the nation's largest energy marketers. ""It's like someone who flies a kite one day, and then is told to go fly a 747 the next.""

One veteran said the state traders lack the practiced subtlety that experience brings. ""You don't just come out to someone and say, 'What's your price?' and then pay it. But that's what some of them have done.""

A senior analyst at a California firm that sells power to the state traders said, ""The word I get from our traders is that a lot of them have made a lot of money off them.""

Palmer said California, for the salaries it's paying, could have done better.

A particular lightning rod for criticism is the $480,000, two-year contract of chief trader Susan T. Lee, 30, who was hired in April for $120 an hour.

With barely a year's experience in the energy industry, she leads a 16-person crew that buys electricity the day before it's needed or for nearly immediate use. State records show that Lee was paid more than $30,000 a month, including overtime, as she began her new duties.

""That lady's got one year's experience, and she's getting 500 grand,"" Palmer said. An experienced trader in private industry, he said, might make $80,000 to $120,000 in a good year, plus bonuses.

""She's certainly making double what I am, but she's worth it,"" said Hart, who has spent two decades as a bureaucrat at the once-obscure Department of Water Resources.

Although Lee could not be reached for comment, Hart said her short tenure in the industry must be judged by the reality of today's evolving trading market. California energy deregulation began only in 1996, and energy trading has changed enormously in just the last year, he said. ""I would argue that somebody who has been involved and engaged for the last year has as much value as anybody [regardless of experience].""

Lee's team members, meanwhile, have been signed to lucrative short-term contracts worth a maximum of $15,000 to $21,000 a month, including housing, rental cars, per diem pay and flights home on days off. State records show that many traders have actually received only about half that maximum amount.

One industry trading manager said he knew nearly all of the new state traders from their work at the Power Exchange. He said several had applied to him for a job after the exchange closed in January but he didn't think they were qualified.

Some traders acknowledge feeling overmatched against veterans of the industry and have had to learn on the job how to compete.

""They know more than me; they've seen it all,"" said state trader Bernard Barretto, a Navy electronics technician before he got a job at the Power Exchange in 1998.

In their own defense, the traders also said they had virtually no leverage in their early months because power reserves were so depleted that they had to buy no matter the cost.

""Our job was to buy whatever we could buy,"" former trader Elaine Griffin said. ""California was truly a captive market.""

Hart says the relative inexperience of his traders hardly matters because they follow strategies devised by higher-ups.

""Do the [traders] go out and start the deal? Yes,"" Hart said. ""Do they cut the final deal? No.""

Far from the trading trenches, the governor sees things differently. The trading arms of companies such as Enron far surpass that of the Department of Water Resources, he said.

""These are very sophisticated operations,"" Davis said. ""They have several meteorologists and banks of media people.""

To protect taxpayer money from being devoured by these savvy private traders in the early days of California's power-buying binge, state officials turned to a technique called ""sleeving."" They used Lee's old Long Beach firm, Mieco Inc., and Allegheny Power to camouflage the state's identity as the buyer.

The technique also allowed California to buy power from companies that had questioned whether the state would pay its bills.

Some traders, however, saw through the guise. The volume of energy being bought on the market by Mieco and Allegheny was the tip-off that California had weighed in.

""I knew it, and I'm pretty sure the rest of the traders out there know about it, too,"" said one trader, who like others, asked not to be named because he still trades power with the state. ""But it worked for a while. It helped keep the short-term prices down.""

Controversy Over Stock Holdings

The state traders were powerless, however, to protect themselves.

Just as they were settling into their new jobs, and energy prices were falling, the administration was stung by the disclosures that 11 of its traders and consultants owned energy stocks. The governor ordered them to divest the holdings within hours or be fired.

Five were ousted anyway because they had previously bought power for the state from a firm--San Jose-based Calpine Corp.--in which they had owned stock.

The highest-ranking of them was former Sacramento utility executive Richard Ferreira, who was hired on a $500,000 contract in January to negotiate long-term power contracts.

The four others were the veteran Mead and three younger buyers: Herman Leung, Constantine Louie and Peggy Cheng. Elaine Griffin, who had resigned just days before the firings, also held Calpine stock while trading for the state.

Most of the traders, who had worked together at the Power Exchange in Alhambra, said they bought the stock before they went to work for the state and had never been warned that ownership was a problem. They said no one asked if they even held any energy shares.

Mead said traders on his state team--such as Cheng, Leung and Louie--had no ability to influence Calpine's stock price because their purchases of the company's electricity were infrequent and small.

Mead said he had openly touted Calpine stock to his colleagues because he'd made so much money on it. He said his investments of $20,000 in 1999 and $134,000 last fall brought him about $400,000 when he was ordered to sell last month.

""You want to know how I picked Calpine?"" he said. ""Investor's Business Daily has a system for selecting stocks, and Calpine showed up on its list of stocks with strong potential.""

Leung said he rarely dealt with Calpine and bought his $2,000 worth of shares on Jan. 22, while still at the Power Exchange, which had a conflict-of-interest policy barring ownership of energy stock.

""I didn't know I would have an opportunity like this at the time,"" Leung said of his briefly held state job. ""I bought it just because I'm interested in the market all the time. I follow it.""

Today, shipped back home from their rented apartments outside Sacramento, the fired traders see themselves as victims of Davis' effort to fend off further criticisms of his handling of the energy crisis.

They bristle at the fact that Davis has not required some of his most influential private advisors to file the kind of disclosure statements that led to their firings.

""The big boys, the ones hiding behind the right not to disclose, those are the ones that ought to be drawing attention,"" Mead said. ""They're the ones who knew how things worked.""

Scenario 1
EPMI makes a forward deal with Duke to provide its ""obligation"" for A/S.
Essentially EPMI is trading off its ""obligation"" to Duke using inter-SC
template which references the SC (Duke) that is taking on the obligation.
No energy is scheduled by EPMI, just the indication that the obligation is
going to Duke.  The energy curve is scheduled by Duke only.  EPMI can not
schedule the energy. Duke is responsible for providing the energy and
receiving the payment or No Pay.  Although, Duke has various options as to
how they will take care of the traded obligation.  Suffice it to say EPMI
only has to trade their obligation and it is then Duke's obligation to deal
with as they choose.  If Duke chooses to let the ISO provide for that
obligation then there would not be any energy or No-Pay issues.

Scenario 2
EPMI has a resource within its portfolio that will self provide the
obligation for A/S.  EPMI puts in a schedule indicating which resource, the
capacity that will be self provided, and the energy that will be bid in.
EPMI recieves the payment for the energy and any No Pay charges.  


Hope this helps.

If this deal was zeroed out (and it has been after the fact), then we should also have received a credit for no longer buying from MPC (the other side of the deal, 
deal #549160). We should only lose $40 (the net difference). Any ideas?

Virgina and Bill:

During our month-end processes I have researched deal #549162.1.  The counterparty did change as Bill pointed out, but what makes you suffer a loss in the prior month adjustments was due to the volume being zeroed out for HE 3.  Originally the deal liquidated with HE3 (40MWh*$135), HE4(15MWh *$135), and HE5 (20MWh*$135), but on 4/19/2001 the volume for HE3 was zeroed out in scheduling, which means originally you were given too much $ for the sale and therefore we are now taking that revenue you made in HE3 back.

Thanks,

Virginia,

I have one question on this month's PMA and some questions from last month.  First, for deal #549162, this deal was originally put in incorrectly as counterparty TacomaSupp.  This counterparty was then changed to Tacomapubuit.  Why does a change in counterparty result in a loss of revenue?  Are we being charged for each counterparty again (like EES and ST-Cali last month), if so, we need to fix this flawed tool. 

Second, for last month, we determined that the WBOM book needs a $108,000 PMA for change in price.  The appropriate price is in Enpower, but the revenue has never appeared (Deal #590753). Remember, this deal was originally input as a buy at $320 and a sell at $30 and liquidated at these prices. The deal is now at $320 and $300.  What do we need to do to get this trued up?
Please come see me with questions.

Thank you for your help.

Just a quick note to acknowledge the great job that Geir Solberg did in helping our office out during Tropical storm Allison.
Our phone lines, computers and cell phones were down.    Additionally,   we were short staffed due to floodwaters downtown.

One of our service customers,  Teco,  wanted to sell some test power in South Texas.   Geir was contacted via satellite phone.
He sold 230 megawatts each hour to AEP.   He used the proper terminology unique to Ercot and sold the energy at a decent price.
He maintained good,  detailed notes and was able to relay this information to me the following Monday.    
Most importantly,  this was a seamless transaction to the customer.

Recently there have been complaints regarding chew in the kitchen sink, chew scattered around the edge of garbage cans, and chew spit cups left on desks. Although we are not the only group that uses tobacco products, we are the most visible. The relaxed atmosphere of the group is a priviledge and I expect each person in the group to be responsible for the appearance of our desk and the perception of our desk by others on the floor. Leaving chew spit cups on other desks or throwing chew in the sink is unacceptable. It is a simple thing.

<<...OLE_Obj...>> The Wholesale Power Marketing Group Invites You To Be Our Guest For The  2001 Fall Energy Fiesta! 

The Wholesale Power Marketing Group cordially extends this invitation to join us Wednesday evening, October 10th through noon Friday, October 12th as a guest at our annual 2001 Fall Energy Fiesta!   This is an occasion to meet all the members of our team, tour our trading floor, explore possible business opportunities and of course, enjoy Albuquerque's historic International Balloon Fiesta!   As our guest, we will provide, at no expense to you, the following:

        

<<...OLE_Obj...>> 
          
          -  Tickets to the Balloon Fiesta 

-  Balloon rides (weather permitting) 
- Ground transportation to and from the airport and throughout your stay 
-       Shared lodging in a Class A Recreational Vehicle on-site at the Fiesta 
-       Meals  
-       Day sight-seeing and shopping trips to Santa Fe or complimentary golf 
-       Fiesta memorabilia 

You will be responsible for your travel to and from Albuquerque. 
I have attached an RSVP form for you to fill out with certain information that is needed prior to your arrival.  Please fill it out and wither email it to me at sstephe@pnm.com < <mailto:sstephe@pnm.com>> or fax it to me at 505/855-6240.

Thanks. 

<<RSVP Form.doc>> 

And........If you decide to go, 

1.  Please email me, call me or fill out the attached form and fax it back to me with your travel information as soon as you know it, so we can arrange times to meet you at the airport. 

2.  In October, Albuquerque can be very cool.  Please bring a light jacket and/or sweater, and some warm clothes, as many of the events we will be hosting are outside.

3.  You will be lodging in a Class a RV on site at the Balloon Fiesta, with one of our other guests.  There will be 3 RV's that we have secured for our guests (6 guests in all), and these RV's will be parked in our own reserved area of the Balloon Fiesta.  This way, there will be no ""early rising"" to attend balloon events, as some of the start times for ascension events are 5:45AM - 7:00 AM!  And you will be in midst of all of the excitement.  These RV's are top of the line: roomy, comfortable, and well-stocked with all the necessities (snacks, drinks, toiletries, sheets, blankets, towels).

4.  All meals will be hosted by us, either at local restaurants or they will be professionally catered to our area. 

We will also host an outing to Santa Fe; sightseeing and museums, or you can play golf instead (please indicate in your reply if you will be renting clubs or bringing your own).    We would also like to treat you to a balloon ride (weather permitting) if you are so inclined.  Just please note it on the attached sheet.

And last but not least, we would like you to provide us with your sweatshirt size so we can send you home with an official Balloon Fiesta sweatshirt.

I have enclosed a schedule of events for you to know what will be happening here at the Balloon Fiesta while you are here.

<<wave 2 schedule of events.doc>> 

All of us at PNM's Wholesale Power Marketing are thrilled that you are coming!  If you have any questions, please feel free to call me.

Subject:	El Paso Units

Gentlemen,

After discussion with Roger, the Four Corners Units 4 and 5 are NOT take or pay.  This means that rather than selling from these units below the Lambda (unit cost is approximately $13), we should ramp them down.  They should still be the last units down (Copper off, then the steamer, then FC's). Because of restrictions on the units you may not be able to ramp the units all the way down all the time. Also, be sure to work closely with the dispatchers to ramp the units back up in a timely fashion. 
I apologize for misinformation on my part regarding these units.  If you have questions please see me, otherwise...spread the word.

Thanks,
Bill"

Bobette from Powerdex will want to speak to you regarding timelines, templates, etc. to set up an hourly index to be published the next day. I gave her your name because of your past experience in deal control. She will likely be calling around 9:30 or 9:45.

It's attached, and I appreciate your feedback (particularly re: a doable filing time for your shop). Included is COB, even though I'm not sure there's enough liquidity to support it. Time will tell. Thanks for the comments on Mid-C; I'll carry on with that as a point, although I'll probably have to define it (perhaps list the buses?) to calm players' concerns.
 
This template is for participants, whom will be kept confidential at all times. I will use purchases and sales, but won't reveal which is which or the identity or positions of any participants. For this index to have any value, accurate numbers must be provided. I assure you, I will respect confidentiality--those who don't, don't deserve to stay in business.
 
I will send you confidentiality agreements and the index methodology for your records, if you like, but first, there will be a beta-testing period during which the methodology may be tweaked. (For example, players may decide they would like to see bal-day deals included within the indexes. We did not include them in the indexes I developed for the Eastern Interconnect, however.)
 
Powerdex has been set up for the purpose of doing these hourly indexes, and integrity is key here. It is my intention for it to be a useful, accurate, comprehensive and independent service. Please let me know what you require from me. It's always a pleasure talking with you.

In order to further clarify our understanding of how the payment mechanism would work in the exhibits of the PSA, I am attaching a summary of the preferred method for compensation under the Pre-NTP and NTP phases of the PSA's.  In particular, on the NTP Lump Sum price determination, we would prefer to see the breakdown of manhours in the format previously transmitted (by task by month), and by Engineering Discipline.  The Canadian rate structure you provided had about 15 or more categories of Engineering Disciplines, and this should be used to reflect the all-in hourly rates times the manhours in each category which will equate to the estimated Lump Sum price noted in the attachment.  

Your organization chart reflects all personnel in Vancouver being assigned to the project team, except the Customer Sponsor.  We would not expect to have to pay for the sponsor's cost, nor any travel time for personnel to/from Atlanta.

We are getting clarification from LED if the actual driving of the test piles will be included in your deliverables or will be done directly by LED during the Oct 1-31 period.  Will advise.

Just a quick note to acknowledge the great job that Geir Solberg did in helping our office out during Tropical storm Allison.
Our phone lines, computers and cell phones were down.    Additionally,   we were short staffed due to floodwaters downtown.

One of our service customers,  Teco,  wanted to sell some test power in South Texas.   Geir was contacted via satellite phone.
He sold 230 megawatts each hour to AEP.   He used the proper terminology unique to Ercot and sold the energy at a decent price.
He maintained good,  detailed notes and was able to relay this information to me the following Monday.    
Most importantly,  this was a seamless transaction to the customer.

Again,  thanks for the help.

We are continuing to refine our deal entry techniques and spreadsheet techniques. We are having great success with EOL so far. For further clarification.
	


	1. ALL DEALS UNDER ST-WHOURLY--except a lending/parking deal or cut. For example if we are lending with ST-SW and we buy for them in NP-15. The buy in NP-15 is under ST-WHOURLY, the EPMICALPOOL Buy/Resale from NP-15 to FC345 is under ST-WHOURLY, the INTER-DESK sale is made under ST-WHOURLY (at the end of the day--see #3), and the sale to EPE is under ST-SW. The export in CAPS is also under ST-SW.

	2. ONE DEAL FOR AN ON-PEAK or OFF-PEAK PURCHASE or SALE.--For example one deal for a sale to the imbalance, one deal for a sale to EPE

	3. ONE DEAL FOR AN INTER-DESK SALE or PURCHASE--done by the NIGHT SHIFT at the weighted average price for the entire strip, transmission costs should be included. We are just averaging the purchase price or sale price for specific deals. (see ST-WBOM SP-15 section of AUG TRADING sheet on 08/29/01 for an example)

	4. INC SHEETS MUST BE MAINTAINED, DEALS ENTERED AND ROUTED EACH HOUR--only way to stay ahead

	5. WE ARE GENERATING SIGNIFICANTLY MORE REVENUE AND PROFIT TRADING WITH EOL (over $130,000 in the last 5 days alone--does not include congestion revenue!)--530+ trades, 13,100 extra mws traded with EOL in 8 days.

	6. MEETING ON TUESDAY 09/04 at 4PM


Finally, I will be out of the office for Friday and will be in Seattle through Sunday. You should be able to reach me on my cell phone (503) 887-3449. If you can not reach me, please refer questions regarding trading to Ryan Slinger, (503) 789-1306.

We have had some issues with EpmiCalPool deals recently and I wanted to provide information for newer members of the group and a quick reminder for crusty veterans as we head into the Thanksgiving Holiday. I have also decided to change our protocol for entering multiple EpmiCalPool deals. Please pay special attention to #5 below.

So, some basic rules about EpmiCalPool deals.

1. EpmiCalPool deals are BUY-RESALE deals--(a transmission deal will work but is not the preferred method)

2. We only BUY from the EpmiCalPool-no exceptions-.

3. EpmiCalPool deals have a $0 price in the buy and sell portions. Please do not enter a price on an EpmiCalPool deal.

4. EpmiCalPool deals must have a delivery point of an CISO tie point or an CISO congestion zone. Good delivery points would be:
Malin, COB N/S, COB S/N, NOB N/S, NOB S/N, Cascade, Captain Jack, Summit, Four Corners 345, Mead 230, Paloverde, NP-15, ZP-26, SP-15.

Bad delivery points would include: Mid-C, Hotsprings, Hidalgo, BC Border.

5. IMPORTANT CHANGES TO BUSINESS PRACTICE HERE EpmiCalPool deals are used to simulate the purchase of transmission from the California ISO. 

	a.) If you have a wheel from tie point to tie point for example Malin to Four Corners for congestion management--than an EpmiCalPool deal from Malin to Four 	Corners would be appropriate. For seperate wheels from tie point to tie point we will NOT be putting in deals from Malin to NP-15, NP-15 to SP-15, and SP-15 to 	Four Corners. 

	b.)However, from Congestion zone to congestion zone inside of California, or if you are moving tie point to a congestion zone--for example Malin to SP-15 we will 	need a Malin to NP-15 and NP-15 to SP-15. This will allow us to better capture congestion across congestion zones in California, and will prepare us for the move 	to FSP.

6. We will initiate this change in business practice HE 1 on Tuesday November 20th.

Epmicalpool deals continue to provide problems with reports. Please see me with any questions.

Thanks,

Bill"

Subject:	Palo Verde  Bottleneck - PLEASE READ
Importance:	High

Is this the only revision you'd like to see?

FYI -

Roger called today to inform us of a [Mark Hall]   [transmission capacity]  bottleneck at Palo Verde. Apparently, El Paso cannot take more than 50 mw into their system at Palo in any given hour; therefore, we  [Mark Hall]  [will] need to monitor El Paso's net schedule to  [Mark Hall]  insure [Mark Hall]  (sic)  that it does not exceed this. This poses some obstacles and opportunities related to the lending agreement. If El Paso is taking a net of 50 mw in at PV, you'll need to procure energy at Four Corners or Greenlee [Mark Hall]   [or buy transmission/do a buy/resell with SRP-PNM-TNP-APS-etc.]  to fill the lending short [Mark Hall]   note-EPE will still deliver us energy at PV- , then enter a zero priced buy-resale [Mark Hall]   in enpower  to get the energy from an alternate delivery point to PV. 

This is how it should take place - 
Day-Ahead
	Buy from El Paso at PV 
	Sell to STSW at PV 
Hour-Ahead	
	Buy from Counterparty such as PNM, SRP, TNP, or APS at FC or Greenlee 
	Buy-Resale from El Paso from FC or Greenlee to PV 

Please let me know if you have questions.

Thanks,
Kate"

Good afternoon, I have attached a draft of the Control Area Services Agreement to this email. Please take a look at it when you have a moment and let me know what you think about it. I understand we may not implement it for a while. However, I thought having an agreement in place might provide us with more flexibility and the ability to take advantage of opportunities as this month winds down. I appreciate your time and feedback.

Thank you,

Please note we have two new Enpower applications currently in use by the Prescheduling Group that are also available for Real Time use. A manual has been placed in your inbox describing the process in detail. You will be using this in place of Lotus Notes to confirm and process cut power schedules going forward. You must check out with all major marketers and utilities each night. This would include but not be limited to: AEP, AES-New Energy, Aquila, Avista, Calpine, Constellation, Coral, Duke, Dynegy, El Paso Merchant, Exelon, Meico, Mirant, Morgan, NCPA, Reliant, PPLMontana, PowerX, Sempra, SMUD, TransAlta, Williams, and southwest utilities such as Pinnacle West, SRP, PNM, PSCO and Pacificorp. Northwest counterparties are checked out by BPA and do not need to be checked again by us (this would include SCL, TCL, PSPL, BPAP, GCPUD, EWEB, IPC, MPC, SNPD, WWP). These checkouts should be started in HE 19 and finished by HE 21. 

NOTE: You must open both PSW and Path Confirmation from your local Enpower Launchpad, which can be found under the Start Menu in Programs/Business Applications/Enpower/Enpower Login. 

Following are a few pointers to help you get started. 

1.	All prescheduled power paths will be loaded into Path Confirmation. This application must be opened from local Enpower and can be found in the menu that drops down from the hand icon at the left under ""Tools.""
2.	A box will appear asking you to select a default trading desk. Choose ""West"" and click ""Okay.""
3.	Supply schedules are shown in gray, transmission in yellow, and market in blue.
4.	Sort paths by clicking and dragging on the heading you'd like to sort by. Suggestion: Sort by counterparty while making confirmation calls. When all schedules with that counterparty are confirmed, highlight each schedule
5.	Highlight the path you'd like to confirm or cut by clicking in the thin box to the very left of the Path Confirmation screen. Highlight multiple rows by holding the ""Control"" button and while selecting multiple rows.
6.	Confirm a path by highlighting and clicking the telephone icon. A screen will come up requesting contact information from the appropriate counterparty. Because this information saves directly to Enpower, save time runs about a minute.
7.	Cut a path by highlighting and clicking the scissors icon. A screen called ""Cut Information"" will come up. Select the ""New Path Cut"" icon in the upper left-hand corner and supply the relevant information (region, cut time, resupply path, Enpower numbers, Turret ID, etc.)
8.	Double click anywhere in a particular row to see a detail of that schedule. This screen will show the terms and hours of the deal as well as volume, price, Enpower deal and OATI tag number.

Lotus Notes is being phased out of operation, and we are working with the Enpower team in Houston to develop a discussion database similar to the one we currently use in Notes. These new applications will be a part of that, so please begin adjusting your nightly schedule checkout and/or cuts procedure accordingly (i.e. Record cut paths in Enpower Path Confirmation, not Lotus Notes.)"

Effective October 1st Real Time individuals will be responsible for anything over $55.00 on their AT&T bill.  As of now you all have 200 minutes per month plus free calling within your group all the time.  You are welcome to come look at recent and old bills to see approximately how many minutes you use within a month.    This might help you to choose a plan that might better suit you.  I urge you to do this soon so you are not stuck with a huge bill in October.  If you decide to go against the group calling plan you will have to remember your minutes talking within the Real Time group will be accounted for.  

I'll list some plans that are available.  If you are working at night and are not able to get a hold of me, please e-mail me with your decision and I will take care of it.

Bill,

Here's an outline of what we talked about for the average price spreadsheet:

Pull deals for WHourly at Mid-Columbia, WSCC_N, NP15, SP15, and (Palo Verde +) WSCC_S
In a tabular format display:  Average price from the schedules for buys and sells for each hour in each region (i.e. Mid-Columbia, WSCC_N, etc.)

Underneath the table display:
On Peak average 
Off Peak average

for later:  (i.e. next version)
sort by groups:  24inc, EOL, EPEC

For clarification:
Average price is per MW not per deal?

I've asked Susmitha Nalluri to work on this for you.  She sits 2 desks down from me and works on the VMS team.  She has experience with spreadsheets, however she is not yet familiar with the EnPower view of the database.  I have given her a query to give her a jumpstart on pulling the data data you need from EnPower.  She and I have also met to go over where the data is being pulled from.  In my abscence she can go to Lei, Pete, Matt or David about questions regarding the EnPower Data.  I told her to feel free to ask you or Kate any questions.  I brought her down to meet you and Kate but did not realize you both (as well as most people) had left around lunchtime.

Kate,

I told her you would be bringing her more information on the Dow Jones sheet.  I forwarded Susmitha our earlier emails about it.

You can find HE 10 through 18 at the bottom of the November Service Sheet. This should be in the same location as the Trading sheet in the Inc sheet section. My understanding is that you were given a copy of the service sheet with the trading sheet yesterday morning. You should find probably another $60,000 maybe $70,000 at the bottom of the sheet. If you have any questions just let me know.

If Bill finds this language agreeable, you can cut and paste my revision and send it to the customer, with the following caveats that you must communicate to the customer:

1.  We can do the load following service under the WSPP.  We cannot commit to term transactions without an EEI Master Power Purchase and Sale Contract in place

2.  If the customer is interested, we can negotiate a more formalized contract for this service.

3.  I reserve the right for Credit or Legal to change our mind about this arrangement and require a more formal contract at any point in the future.  If I change my mind, though, I'll give everyone plenty of notice.

4.  If the customers' lawyers or contracts personnel have any questions about this arrangement, or doing business with Enron in general, I am available to meet with them by phone or in person.

Enron is interested in assisting Grays Harbor, Benton and Franklin with load balancing by buying and selling power in the real time market.  When requested, Enron will  provide competitive bids and offers on an hourly basis.  To help us provide you with the most competitive prices we can, we ask that you communicate all trades to us at least 45 minutes before actual physical delivery would occur.  We can do transactions on shorter notice, but it is more difficult to ensure a competitive price as the time for physical delivery nears.  In addition, as you may be aware, the wholesale power market can only accomodate transactions involving quantities of energy that are in whole MWs; i.e., there is no market for partial megawatts.  Therefore, each transaction must be at least 1 MW, and we would prefer, but not require, that you transact with us in volumes of at least 5 MW.

Steve here is my thoughts on the comercial language that should be in the contract

Enron is interested in assisting Grays Harbor, Benton and Franklin in load balancing by buying and selling power in the real time market.  Enron will engage its best efforts to provide the strongest bids and offers on an hourly basis.  The timing of when Enron is informed of the PUD's positions will have a large affect on the prices received.  Enron would appreciate all trades to be communicated at or before 15 minutes past the hour for the following trading hour.  In addition, Enron can only trade integer power volumes due to the wholesale power practices.  As a result, the minimum power quantity must be at least 1 MW.  Enron prefers power volumes to be at least 5 MW.

Bill,
I just wanted to let you know that it's going to take a couple weeks (I think) until I receive access to the timekeeping system.  Apparently after requesting access, ISC sends back a ticket number and an FYI (below).  
As soon as I receive access I will go back for your group and enter their time, and from then on keep track of the groups time for each month.

Thanks, Jill

A quick note regarding Pace transmission reservations on their oasis sites.  We have recently paid PACE $57,000 for transmission in May that we reserved but did not flow.  PACE says that their transmission is on a take or pay basis.  My contention is that we may have reserved the transmission, but then attempted to remove it immediately (wrong hour, wrong mw value on the submission etc.) and were unable to, or were told by the dispatcher that the dispatcher would take care of it.   Then nothing happens.  There are two things we need to do to prevent this.

	One: Submit our transactions correctly the first time.  Then withdraw them immediately through the Pacificorp Oasis system if there is a problem.

	Two: Send me an email each time the dispatchers remove requests on our behalf, or if We/PAC are/is unable to take the request out of their computer system.

Hopefully, this will prevent the extra charges, or give us a means to pull tapes and contest the charges.

Thanks for your help in limiting these egregious expenses

The compensation issue is still under review by our management.  The T&M rates AMEC has provided for the Pre-NTP PSA are all we have from AMEC at this point.  We do not have the NTP rates worked out for Exhibits yet. The current document is still in draft form and we are considering your wording, however our management is adamant at achieving an all-in rate per hour for the NTP PSA, so we consider this to be an open issue until we see your lump sum price estimate.  I assumed your position is that 60% is ""deemed"" to be what I refer to as the Variable Rate in the attached document.  Mike

Mike ,as we have discussed several times Amec will perform the work based on trhe rate schedules provided ton date with a lump sum based on the estimated hours times these rates.This does not mean we will provide the profit/overhead /bare wage breakdowns as described herein.We also said we would execute work in overrun at 60% of the scedule rates.This is what was discussed and written into the latest documents we reviewed last Friday.I am available in Toronto for awhile this a.m. at 905-8295400 ext.2489 if we need to discuss again.

In order to further clarify our understanding of how the payment 
mechanism would work in the exhibits of the PSA, I am attaching a 
summary of the preferred method for compensation under the Pre-NTP and 
NTP phases of the PSA's.  In particular, on the NTP Lump Sum price 
determination, we would prefer to see the breakdown of manhours in the 
format previously transmitted (by task by month), and by Engineering 
Discipline.  The Canadian rate structure you provided had about 15 or 
more categories of Engineering Disciplines, and this should be used to 
reflect the all-in hourly rates times the manhours in each category 
which will equate to the estimated Lump Sum price noted in the 
attachment.  

Your organization chart reflects all personnel in Vancouver being 
assigned to the project team, except the Customer Sponsor.  We would not 
expect to have to pay for the sponsor's cost, nor any travel time for 
personnel to/from Atlanta. 

We are getting clarification from LED if the actual driving of the test 
piles will be included in your deliverables or will be done directly by 
LED during the Oct 1-31 period.  Will advise.

Subject:	Fastest Way to Handle Colstrip Cuts



When Colstrip goes down we will be short at Montana system and long at PGE System.  We need to buy a transmission wheel from BPA (Account#736780) from PGE System to the Montana System Border.  If need be we can also do a Buy-Resale with WWP to move the energy from PGE Sys/Mid-C/LOLO to the Montana System Border.  The method for documentation and cleaning up enpower are below.


1.)  Be sure to begin with a physical cut sheet (in drawer above SAR's).

2.) In enpower, build an index forward buy from PGE under STNW book for the total amount of mws cut due to colstrip going down.  Use the DOW JONES MIDC index (remember to specify in the index if it is on or off-peak).  Enter an offset of .10  .  

2.) Enter a transmission deal from BPA.   (MIDC to MPC SYS)  The transmission fee is $2.52.  Build the transmission deal under STNW.

3.) Go into deal scheduling and query  under the counterparty PGE.  Select all

4.) Bring up all deals of the counterparties involved at Colstrip---- specifically, Ashgrove,Conocpil, Energywesr, Louisiana Pacific, and Smurfit Stone, etc.
	(these enpower deal numbers can be located under the counterparties name in lotus notes.)

5.)Zero out the buy from PGE @MPC SYS

6.) Finally link the deals.

7.) Check real time postion manager, make sure you are flat.

8.) Make cuts in Lotus Notes Cuts Database (this is the most time consuming portion of this procedure).

9.) Make notes in Discussion Forum

10.) Email appropriate groups, Kate Symes, and myself.

If you have questions regarding this procedure please let me know.

Chip,

As we figured out a couple of weeks ago, most of our ADS cards have expired.  We were then using Brett Hunsucker's card.  If you remember, we were waiting on the CAISO to send us new cards and new passwords about two weeks ago.  Unfortunately Brett's card appears to have expired this morning as we can no longer log in.  We are consequently unable to communicate with the CAISO over the ADS.  We may now be in violation of our participating generator agreement with the CAISO.  Is there something that I can do to speed this process, perhaps lodge a complaint with the CAISO or our client rep?  Do you have any ETA from the CAISO on our cards and passwords?  All your help is appreciated.

Ronnie Bagley's access card has died.  Can you replace card number 29776 with card number 37586.  I have issued card and he still needs access to the EB.
Thanks.

Awww Jeahh.  It's nice to hear from you.  Ive 
been trying to get in touch with yall for quite 
some time.

Please reply back to this message and let me 
know how ""Things"" are.  Yes, the question is 
ambiguous, but try to go with it.

In response to ""What up?:""

Everything has reached a new status quo. I live 
in Gig Harbor and attend class at UW Tacoma 
(UWT for short).  Class is great and their are 
plenty of beautiful lasses for viewing 
pleasure.  Hopefully I will be out of GH soon.  
I will start looking for jobs in Portland, 
Seattle, and SF (possibly) in Spring.  I have 
not been working on my tan.

I would really like to visit the city of Roses 
in the next few weekends.  What are your 
plans?   I hope everything is well with you.  
Please write back soon.

Buenos Nachos,
Scott

Subject:	EPE Reconciliation Model: Follow-up

Good afternoon -

I wanted to quickly follow-up to make sure everyone is aware of the new EPE Reconciliation Model's location and status. I just skimmed through the first 8 days of this month, and we show no variances between the Real Time El Paso model and our CARP report. 

The reconciliation model can be found at:

	m:/Electric/Epe/Epe01/July01/July EPE Reconciliation

Please let me know if you have any questions.

I just wanted to bring to your attention the volume of congestion that we relieved last night.
It looks like 28 mws at $198 and 75 mws at $223.00.
This should be at total revenue of $22,269.00.

Please see me with any questions.

We have resolved almost all of the recent PMA sheet.  The Tacoma/MPC deal is fine if its zeroed out for HE 3.  I just need to have the cost zeroed out as well as the revenue.  Currently only the revenue has been zeroed out and if I receive the credit for buying from MPC I am satisfied.  Fran is aware of this.

I am still having a problem with the WBOM $108,000 as you are aware.  This would be the only outstanding PMA and whatever the problem is with our tools (if any) likely needs to be resolved.

I appreciate your hard work on tracking down this $108,000.
The risk sheet is on my desk.

Thanks, 

Bill"

We have asked every single counterparty in the NW to sell us energy.  We bid $300 to PowerX and were told that they were abiding by the cap.
We are working hard to get them the energy that they need and will continue to do so.

Subject:	Montana Power Company (MPC) Energy Imbalance

Bill; Mike Cashell (MPC's Transmission Mgr.) just phoned me concerned, because MPC's Real-Time group requested EPMI purchase energy for them under our existing Energy Imbalance structure, and was notified by our Real-Time group that due to the newly implemented FERC price cap, we were have difficulty securing any resources.  Just to clarify things, we are settling MPC's Choice customers Energy Imbalance position, and PP&L Montana has the right to any length resulting from MPC's ""domestic"" load Energy Imbalance.  In other words MPC is settling two separate Energy Imbalance accounts, so during the hour they may be turning energy back to PP&L Montana, while at the same time finding themselves short for the Choice loads.  During the recent bullish pricing conditions, Choice customer were leaving themselves long, as of late, MPC is experiencing the Choice customers doing the opposite, positioning themselves short.  The net result is that MPC will most likely be expecting us to fill a short position from this point on, so I'd really like to see what we can do to honor their requests, mindful of the favorable position we've enjoyed over the last several months. Let me know if you'd like to discuss this further, or better yet if you've got a workable solution to the problem.  In the meantime, thanks again to you and your staff for the outstanding performance thus far in dealing with MPC.   John"

Group,

I received a call from Warren McReynold at the BPA today.  Warren was concerned with the level of service that our group is providing.  Warren explained to me the necessity and importance of calling in and reporting the actual amount of energy generated by Grays Harbor and Frontier EVERY hour.  The group at BPA cannot close their accounting books and meet reliability performance measures without our information.  I am meeting with Warren on Tuesday.  Warren is inclined to recommend to BPA that we are incapable of this service because of our inconsistent performance.  Such a recommendation would severely limit Enron's ability to produce value for our service customers in the near term and would likely prevent us from attracting new customers.  I believe that we can provide Warren's group with the information that it needs with minimal impact to our trading.

Therefore: 

We must call Grays Harbor and Frontier at the top of EVERY hour.  Then we need to call BPA and communicate the ACTUAL energy generated, not an estimate.  Finally, sign off the hour in the services book.  Les has provided us with the needed information for each day. Reserves can only be used for the hour that we are in, than we must resupply the schedule from a different source by working with the BPA marketers. If you have a question regarding reserves or pulling a schedule--please call Les or me.

If this process takes more than 5 minutes, please let me know. It is each trader's responsibilty to make this work.  It should be noted that we need to do this even if the generator is prescheduled, and must to continue to do this until these generators are automatically metered.  And yes, we will be compensated by the Services desk for our work. 

This service is a priority and should be treated as such.

Please see me with your comments and concerns regarding this job function.

Thanks,
Bill
